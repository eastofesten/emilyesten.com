# Hi, I'm Emily Esten.

Hi, My name is *Emily Esten*, and I’m currently the Judaica Digital Humanities Coordinator at Penn Libraries as well as Site Designer for Contingent Magazine.

I’m interested in technology and communities, especially as it relates to public humanities work. I want to build innovative digital projects with cultural institutions that engage audiences with objects, stories, and ideas. My passion is for collaborating on public projects that think critically about audience, content, and use of technology.

Broadly speaking, I’m interested in digital humanities, public history, public humanities, and digital culture.
