Hi, My name is **Emily Esten**, and I’m currently the [Judaica Digital Humanities Coordinator at Penn Libraries](https://judaicadh.github.io) as well as Site Designer for [Contingent Magazine](http://contingentmagazine.org/).

I’m interested in digital public humanities, which thinks about audience, content, and methods in relation to the projects we build with technology. Broadly speaking, I borrow from museums, digital humanities, public history, public humanities, and digital culture.
