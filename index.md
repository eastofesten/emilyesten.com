Hi, My name is **Emily Esten**, and I’m currently the Judaica Digital Humanities Coordinator at [Penn Libraries](https://judaicadh.library.upenn.edu), where I spearhead projects that facilitate access to and use of Penn's Judaica collections, promoting them and making connections between them and dispersed Judaica content around the globe.

I work in digital public humanities, which means proactively engaging with audience, content, and methods in relation to the projects we build with technology and data. I create and apply digital tools to foster connection and dialogue around cultural heritage. Having played an active role in shaping collaborations, training, and programming around understanding data, I am especially excited to tackle data-related projects and educate others to do the same.


Over five years of working in higher education and cultural institutions, I have explored different approaches to developing effective digital content. I also serve as Web Manager for [Contingent Magazine](http://contingentmagazine.org/) and the Director of Communications for the [National Emerging Museum Professionals Network](https://nationalempnetwork.org/).
