Hi, My name is **Emily Esten**, and I’m currently the Project Lead, DocMaps at [Knowledge Futures](https://www.knowledgefutures.org/).

In my varied work experience - from project lead to curator, educator to site developer - my primary focus has been in engaging with audiences, content, and tools to build better research and teaching communities. I’ve played an active role in shaping collaborations, training, and programming around digital tools for scholarly communication. 

In addition to my day-to-day work, I've done freelance site developmemt for [Contingent Magazine](https://contingentmagazine.org/) and [Journey75 at the Mark Twain House & Museum](https://journey75.org/). I previously served as Director of Communications for the [National Emerging Museum Professionals Network](https://nationalempnetwork.org/).
