  <h1 class="post-title">Rev. Mr. Thurber&#8217;s Poem to the Seamen&#8217;s Bethel</h1>
  <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2014 <small><em>tagged in </em></small></span>
  
  <p>I’ve been working through a few projects this past week for my internship, and working with the microfilm has certainly been exciting! (But more on that later.) One of my tasks was looking into the history of the plaque outside the Seamen’s Bethel in New Bedford. I found this poem, printed in <em>The Morning Mercury</em>, which was read at the tablet’s ceremony. <!-- more --></p>

<p><em>Just one hundred years ago</em></p>

<p><em>When people and ships were very slow</em></p>

<p><em>And this town was full of men and boys you know</em></p>

<p><em>Looking for a ship on a whaling voyage to go</em></p>

<p><em>They came from every shore and land</em></p>

<p><em>From Greenland’s icy mountains</em></p>

<p><em>From India’s coral strand</em></p>

<p><em>Where Afric’s sunny fountains</em></p>

<p><em>Roll down their golden sand.</em></p>

<p><em>Like waifs upon the ocean they drifted o’er the Sea of Life</em></p>

<p><em>With few to aid or pity them as they struggled with sin and strife</em></p>

<p><em>‘Twas then our fathers saw the need</em></p>

<p><em>Of a “Seamen’s Bethel” so to grant them moral and</em></p>

<p><em>Spiritual shelter indeed</em></p>

<p><em>So the founding of this Bethel came within their sacred plan</em></p>

<p><em>For to snatch from the vile the vicious and the brothel every single sailor man</em></p>

<p><em>How well their work was finished we want the world to know</em></p>

<p><em>For the Sailor’s Church our fathers builded has lived through gale, flood, and fire since one hundred years ago.</em></p>

<p><em>The builders of this Seamen’s Bethel have long since gone to their eternal rest</em></p>

<p><em>Our ships with their crews of that ago their final resting places well – God knows best</em></p>

<p><em>But the “Seamen’s Bethel” treasured and held in hallowed memory by them so</em></p>

<p><em>Still lives for she was founded upon a rock one hundred years ago.</em></p>

<p><em>In a twofold manner ‘tis not fiction but ‘tis true</em></p>

<p><em>That boulder girths our harbor and it binds Johnny Cake Hill too</em></p>

<p><em>Upon that rock this dear old Bethel stands</em></p>

<p><em>Still another rock is her foundation which can ne’er be destroyed by the use of mortal hands</em></p>

<p><em>With that truth the hearts of our fathers were aglow</em></p>

<p><em>Our fathers who preached here one hundred years ago</em></p>

<p><em>For Christ is that rock upon which she is founded</em></p>

<p><em>By His “Sea of Love” like an island all men are surrounded</em></p>

<p><em>From her pulpit this theme has been preached through</em></p>

<p><em>Summer’s heat and winter’s drifting snow</em></p>

<p><em>The unchangeable God’s love so earnestly preached here one hundred years ago.</em></p>

<p><em>We still offer men the same salvation just as full and as copiously free</em></p>

<p><em>The men of the land and the men of the sea</em></p>

<p><em>The invitation by sermon has been offered every week</em></p>

<p><em>The choir provides fine music while the spiritually hungry at their Father’s table do eat</em></p>

<p><em>They then go out and tell others who are happy to know</em></p>

<p><em>Of a little Church Around the Corner where they may worship as they did one hundred years ago.</em></p>

<p><em>And during the year of nineteen and twenty-nine</em></p>

<p><em>Our congregations have followed along in the same old-fashioned line</em></p>

<p><em>For the total number of worshipers county 6195 who have passed through the Bethel’s door</em></p>

<p><em>Who prayed and sand in the same old time spirit of one hundred years ago and more</em></p>

<p><em>Of this number 1957 burdened seamen knowing not where else to go</em></p>

<p><em>Brought to this sacred altar their soul, their sin and their homesick feelings just as the homesick sailor lads did one hundred years ago</em></p>

<p><em>Now the old time ships have unbent their sails</em></p>

<p><em>And the old time seamen have fought their last gales</em></p>

<p><em>Yet to the aged Seamen’s Bethel sailors still come and go</em></p>

<p><em>Just as they came here to worship one hundred years ago</em></p>

<p><em>The needy also came as in days of yore</em></p>

<p><em>For during 1929 we’ve materially cared for just eighty-four</em></p>

<p><em>Forty of these men were destitute and sorely in need</em></p>

<p><em>Five had been shipwrecked and were stranded indeed</em></p>

<p><em>Other than the Mariner’s Home they knew not where to go</em></p>

<p><em>Just as shipwrecked and stranded seamen sought its shelter one hundred years ago</em></p>

<p><em>Also we’ve cared for the afflicted, the sick and the dead</em></p>

<p><em>Ninety-one services for the departed we’ve said</em></p>

<p><em>Of this number sixty-eight were men of the sea</em></p>

<p><em>Or a member of a sailor’s family as the case might be</em></p>

<p><em>This custom has always been followed as past records will show</em></p>

<p><em>Since the birth of this society one hundred years ago</em></p>

<p><em>So you’re speaking out old Bethel, you’re declaring to burdened men</em></p>

<p><em>What a joy, what a blessing to aching heart these long years you’ve been</em></p>

<p><em>Like a beacon on the hilltop you’ve helped to guide the straying seamen home.</em></p>

<p><em>The weather vane at your truck the changing winds to men you’ve shown</em></p>

<p><em>And to the wanderer far and near, high and low</em></p>

<p><em>You’ve proven that God’s love is not fickle like the wind, or</em></p>

<p><em>Shifting like the weather vane, but it’s always the same just as it was one hundred years ago</em></p>

<p><em>The aged barks of faithfully revolving on your lofty spine</em></p>

<p><em>Reflects the fancies of your worthy sires</em></p>

<p><em>Our father modeled that ship this sailors’ church to adorn</em></p>

<p><em>To show to men whether the wind blows east or west or gale be short of long.</em></p>

<p><em>They, too, need a ship and a pilot who can outride every blow</em></p>

<p><em>Just as that ship has weathered every gale since one hundred years ago.</em></p>

<p><em>When men read the tablets that tell the saddened tale</em></p>

<p><em>Of the way those brave fellows were stricken down by shark, by whale or gale</em></p>

<p><em>Our hearts turn to God in deep gratitude and in sincere prayer</em></p>

<p><em>Because those old time sailor men placed these cenotaphs there</em></p>

<p><em>If our dear ones are in the great and mighty deep</em></p>

<p><em>Sit not on its shore line in sorrow, grieve and weep</em></p>

<p><em>If they have no cenotaph to mark their final resting place</em></p>

<p><em>Let’s enshrine them in our hearts there we’ll find an open space</em></p>

<p><em>Then that tablet you may carry with you every single place you go.</em></p>

<p><em>That’s the way the cenotaphs to the sacred memory our</em></p>

<p><em>New Bedford seamen started just one hundred years ago.</em></p>

<p><em>– Rev. Mr. Thurber</em></p>
