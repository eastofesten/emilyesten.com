   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the project manager and developer for &lt;a href=&quot;http://judaicadh.library.upenn.edu&quot;&gt;Judaica Digital Humanities at the Penn Libraries&lt;/a&gt;, I’m excited to announce the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://singermanja2.exhibits.library.upenn.edu/&quot;&gt;Digital Second Edition of Judaica Americana&lt;/a&gt;. This is an Omeka database which draws from Robert Singerman’s &lt;em&gt;Judaica Americana,&lt;/em&gt; a bibliography chronicling American Jewish book production until 1900. The Digital Second Edition contains 3,000 supplemental entries to the print edition. The project’s features allow users to search the bibliography by author, language, holding institution, and various tags, as well as find open-access links to digitized Jewish monographs, serials, and periodicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the project at &lt;a href=&quot;https://singermanja2.exhibits.library.upenn.edu/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;singermanja2.exhibits.library.upenn.edu/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additional information about the project can be found on the Judaica DH website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://judaicadh.github.io/work/judaica-americana&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;judaicadh.github.io/work/judaica-americana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was responsible for the data preparation and project methodology. As the developer and designer, I designed the look and feel of the site, editing the Omeka theme that is used for the navigation and user interaction with the site. My blog post on the project development process can be found on the Judaica DH website at (https://judaicadh.github.io/blog/about-singermanja2/)[https://judaicadh.github.io/blog/about-singermanja2/].&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The History of Quarantine (Broad Street Review)</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/highlights/exhibit-review/2020-03-10-history-of-quarantine/"/>
   <updated>2020-03-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/highlights/exhibit-review/history-of-quarantine</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadstreetreview.com/museums/the-philadelphia-city-archives-present-the-history-of-the-lazaretto&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; has been republished with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broadstreetreview.com&quot;&gt;Broad Street Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the spread of COVID-19 to nearly &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/335ppyD&quot;&gt;70 countries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2W2o0XV&quot;&gt;36 US states&lt;/a&gt; (including the District of Columbia) as of March 10, 2020, many wonder whether cities like Philadelphia are prepared for the epidemic. While the Department of Public Health has taken steps to prevent its spread and reiterates that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2IuECjf&quot;&gt;risk to the average Philadelphian&lt;/a&gt; remains extremely low, it’s worth noting that the city does have a unique place in the history of quarantines. A timely exhibit at the Philadelphia City Archives takes visitors through the history of the oldest quarantine station in the United States: the Philadelphia Lazaretto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.broadstreetreview.com/images/uploads/posts/_framed/H1RvB11E-1024-822.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing of the Philadelphia quarantine system&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stop here, please: an 1856 drawing of the Philadelphia quarantine station viewed from the water, by artist James Fuller Queen. (Image courtesy of the Library of Congress.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First stop from the sea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than 150 years, Philadelphia operated two facilities known as lazaretto, or quarantine hospitals for maritime travel. The first lazaretto, located at Province Island, was built in 1743. Fifty years later, however, nearly 10 percent of the city population died from a yellow fever epidemic, and even more fled out of fear. In response, the city established a Board of Health and built a second lazaretto in 1799, located in Tinicum Township and further from the densely populated city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ship passing along the Delaware River and looking to dock in Philadelphia would first stop at the Philadelphia Lazaretto. There, the Quarantine Master and physician would inspect the cargo, crew, and passengers for any sign of contagious disease. If they were cleared, ships would leave the next day with a certificate of health and continue to their destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all ships were so lucky. If any disease was found, a dreaded yellow flag would be raised at the site. The delay in the ship’s journey could be anywhere from a week to a month as the ship’s cargo would be sterilized and fumigated and all crew and passengers were quarantined. Healthy travelers waited in other facilities while sick passengers were treated in the Lazaretto hospital with very basic medical techniques to lessen symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millions arrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of passengers, including immigrants arriving in Philadelphia, passed through the Lazaretto. This exhibit highlights two important moments from the quarantine hospitals’ history. In 1800, a naval ship known as the U.S.S. Ganges intercepted two ships, the Prudent and Phebe, that were illegally trafficking Africans off the coast of Cuba. The ships were brought back to the Philadelphia Lazaretto, where the 135 Africans on board were detained and treated. Following a court order, the Pennsylvania Abolition Society took guardianship over the men, women, and children, who were given the last name “Ganges” and placed in indentured servitude throughout the greater Philadelphia area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.broadstreetreview.com/images/uploads/posts/_framed/H1RvB11E-1024-822.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photograph of the administrative building, 1936&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve been here before: the administrative building at Philadelphia Lazaretto in 1936 (Image courtesy of the Library of Congress.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the exhibit notes, quarantine hasn’t always been effective as one would hope. In 1870, a careless ship known as the Home arrived at the Lazaretto, having lost its captain to sickness and come to a filthy condition. During its fumigation process, many fell ill due to cross-contamination. The outbreak killed at least 10 people, including key members of Lazaretto staff. A diagram of the facility from this period shows the scene of the outbreak, with various arrows pointing to the paths of infection. The staffers who succumbed were commemorated in the annual city address, as displayed in the exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An important legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Board of Health of the City of Philadelphia operated the Tinicum Township facility until 1895. Following its closure, the Lazaretto was repurposed as a recreational facility and seaplane port during World War II. Through local efforts by preservationists like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/39E63D9&quot;&gt;Friends of the Lazaretto&lt;/a&gt;, the remains of the Lazaretto &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2vVxnhx&quot;&gt;have been preserved&lt;/a&gt; and the site is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2vQmZra&quot;&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; on the National Register of Historic Places. This small exhibit at the Philadelphia City Archives explores the Lazaretto’s important legacy in US immigration, labor history, and the development of public health practice. For me, it certainly brought some comfort: dealing with infectious disease has been a longstanding practice for our city, and quarantine is one of the best solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-when-where&quot;&gt;WHAT, WHEN, WHERE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The History of the Lazaretto&lt;/em&gt;. Through April 30, 2020 at Philadelphia City Archives, 548 Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia. (215) 685-9401 or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phila.gov/phils/carchive.htm&quot;&gt;phila.gov/phils/carchive.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The City Archies are wheelchair-accessible. Free off-street parking is available at the nearby Target lot.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Illuminating Iranian Tradition (Broad Street Review)</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/highlights/exhibit-review/2020-01-13-illuminating-iranian-tradition/"/>
   <updated>2020-01-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/highlights/exhibit-review/illuminating-iranian-tradition</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadstreetreview.com/artmuseums/twelve-gates-arts-presents-immanence-tazhib-in-america-behnaz-karjoo&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; has been republished with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broadstreetreview.com&quot;&gt;Broad Street Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve Gates Arts, Philadelphia’s premier location for contemporary and modern art of South Asia and the Middle East, is starting out the new decade with an important and timely feature of Iranian American artist Behnaz Karjoo. In her new solo exhibition, Immanence: Tazhib in America, Karjoo brings together her creative and intellectual pursuits in returning to the traditional art of illumination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.broadstreetreview.com/images/uploads/posts/_framed/ijjTL9dP-1049-1399.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Behnaz Karjoo's &amp;quot;Jewels of the Heart&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capturing eyes from the sidewalk: Behnaz Karjoo’s ‘Jewels of the Heart.’ (Image courtesy of Twelve Gates Arts.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curated by Josue Chavez, Kira Simon-Kennedy, Mikail Wright-Kwon, and An Xiao Mina, the exhibit displays two solo artists and two artist collectives using many styles of memes for civic good. The show explores meme tactics to address government censorship, dominant media narratives, and power negotiations on local and global levels, taking us to China, India, Nicaragua, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tazhib then and now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tazhib&lt;/em&gt; comes from the Arabic word for “gold,” referring to an Iranian gilding art. A form of Islamic illumination, &lt;em&gt;tazhib&lt;/em&gt; uses gold and natural pigments to create outstanding geometric and artistic designs. The practice dates back more than a millennium, changing over time in patterns, colors, and purpose. Once used solely to adorn manuscripts or religious materials, &lt;em&gt;tazhib&lt;/em&gt; now functions as a beautiful and intricate art in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This show traces not only the evolution of &lt;em&gt;tazhib&lt;/em&gt; as an art form but Karjoo’s own development as an artist. Her works range from traditional illumination found alongside Quran calligraphic verses to more abstract representations of concepts in Sufi mysticism. The exhibition gains its name from three key works: &lt;em&gt;The Solace of the Eyes: Qurratul-Ayn&lt;/em&gt; (2019), &lt;em&gt;Yearning&lt;/em&gt; (2019), and &lt;em&gt;Panjtan&lt;/em&gt; (2018), all displaying Karjoo’s technical mastery and personal inspirations from spiritual creativity. These three pieces, spread throughout the gallery, borrow from traditional iconography and stories to fashion a tale of a higher power engaging with us and offering protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every atom’s pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rumi says that every atom in the universe is yearning for union with the Beloved,” reads one label. Karjoo notes her particular interest in the repetition of &lt;em&gt;tazhib&lt;/em&gt;, in its recurring patterns of symmetric designs, and its similarity to the repetition of religious practice in the various stories referenced on the labels on each piece. This inner divinity, manifested in the material world of art as well as the spiritual enlightenment of the universe, is absolutely captivating in all of Karjoo’s work. And indeed, it seems to speak to others—the artworks capture the attention of passersby on the street, drawing them into the gallery to fully appreciate the exhibit up close. The immanence is in &lt;em&gt;tazhib&lt;/em&gt;’s inherent beauty, as is present in the stories told as well as the art we see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divine materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Twelve Gates Arts planned this exhibition well in advance of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2uN1Pth&quot;&gt;recent events&lt;/a&gt; like the US president’s threats to Iranian cultural sites, the show is a timely reminder of the importance of preserving cultural heritage central to the lives of Iranians. The exhibit’s opening reception was a huge success, bringing many members of the diasporic community together in solidarity and celebration, supporting the cultural heritage that unites them here in America. As one Instagram user &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2TkMHNW&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “cannot wait to get lost in the beauty of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2tYjsFW&quot;&gt;@behnazkarjoo&lt;/a&gt;’s work in the midst of all this ugliness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the exhibition, Twelve Gates Arts will &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2uMav36&quot;&gt;host a workshop&lt;/a&gt; with Karjoo to introduce the materials and techniques used in traditional illumination. Karjoo’s art and community engagement efforts encourage viewers to consider to consider the “divine presence in the material world.” As the Twelve Gates Arts mission itself says, let those who visit this exhibition remember the duty to preserve these artistic traditions for the sake of Iranian diasporic community.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Radical Power of Memes (Broad Street Review)</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/highlights/exhibit-review/2019-10-03-meme-tactics/"/>
   <updated>2019-10-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/blog/highlights/exhibit-review/meme-tactics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadstreetreview.com/cross-cultural/the-center-for-media-at-risk-presents-meme-tactics#&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; has been republished with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broadstreetreview.com&quot;&gt;Broad Street Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral memes on the Internet have a bold and brash presence in our world. As a communications strategy, meme tactics can be used to spread messages and bring new stories to the forefront of public conversation. An exhibition at the University of Pennsylvania’s new &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2BV2BVu&quot;&gt;Center for Media at Risk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meme Tactics&lt;/em&gt;, uses the term “memetic expression”—images, videos, information circulating rapidly from one person to the next—for interactive discourse around difficult issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.broadstreetreview.com/images/uploads/posts/_framed/Lz5KhRV2-678-666.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amy Suo Wu’s wearable zine honors Chinese anarcho-feminist He-Yin Zhen. (Photo by Emily Esten.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curated by Josue Chavez, Kira Simon-Kennedy, Mikail Wright-Kwon, and An Xiao Mina, the exhibit displays two solo artists and two artist collectives using many styles of memes for civic good. The show explores meme tactics to address government censorship, dominant media narratives, and power negotiations on local and global levels, taking us to China, India, Nicaragua, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group tactics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While varied in medium, time, and approach, the two featured artist collectives work to raise awareness of hyperlocal issues in their respective countries. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/344wCy6&quot;&gt;Dalit Panthers Archive&lt;/a&gt; preserved the art and revolutionary writings of the Dalit Panthers of Maharashtra, a resistance group against caste discrimination. The Panthers used self-published print media and culture to challenge the hegemony of the high-caste editors and writers. The archive, established in 2016, aims to digitize, translate, and make public the Dalit Panthers’ radical ideas through reprinting magazines, posters, and other self-published material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other group on display, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2MVU2zL&quot;&gt;Sponge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spongegourdcollective.mystrikingly.com/&quot;&gt; Gourd Collective&lt;/a&gt;, documents the dark side of Chinese urban development. In the group’s &lt;em&gt;Nothing Ever Happens Here&lt;/em&gt;, green screens along planned high-speed rail routes juxtapose images of local residents with the proposed transformation of their landscape—changes the residents have no say in, without knowledge of the urban planning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solo tactics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two solo artists, on the other hand, take an intercultural approach to spreading messages from one community to another. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2peeQtD&quot;&gt;Amy Suo Wu&lt;/a&gt;’s interest in analog stenography, or secret writing hidden in plain sight, manifests in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2NkGLjm&quot;&gt;Thunderclap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a wearable zine embedded with the erased writings of Chinese anarcho-feminist He-Yin Zhen. A play on the fashion trend of using nonsensical English phrases, &lt;em&gt;Thunderclap&lt;/em&gt; serves as both decorative and political performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elyla Sinvergüenza’s &lt;em&gt;Cartas Mojadas &lt;/em&gt;(wet letters) is a hand-delivered dialogue between communities in Nicaragua and China, both impacted by the Grand Canal Project. The Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development, controlled by a Chinese billionaire, will develop a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, at the expense of thousands of Indigenous people and Nicaraguan farming families, who will lose their lands. The wall of letters include English, Spanish, and Mandarin translations, as well as QR codes to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2Ppyxcu&quot;&gt;project web page&lt;/a&gt;, for Beijing communities to hear from the people affected in Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See for yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boosting the art on display, the Zine Library for &lt;em&gt;Meme Tactics&lt;/em&gt; is essential for learning more about the artists and experiencing these meme tactics for yourself. Currently, the library includes issues of &lt;em&gt;Chakravarty&lt;/em&gt;, a daily zine of the Dalit Panthers Archive, and &lt;em&gt;People’s Square&lt;/em&gt;, an in-depth perspective of China’s urban development published by Sponge Gourd Collective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also of interest is &lt;a href=&quot;http://amysuowu.net/content/choice-translator-0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Choice of a Translator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2018), a transcript of a talk on censorship and steganography given by Wu in Beijing in 2017. Concerned about a suspected government spy in the audience, Wu and her translator Zhuxin Wang were able to simultaneously give the talk in English and Mandarin, evading and self-censoring more radical meanings of the talk in the latter language. _Meme Tactics _visitors can read the English transcript and the Chinese translation translated back into English, reading for modifications, or words deliberately left out of the talk in Mandarin. And new zines are to be added each month by exhibit sponsor&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2PAkSPE&quot;&gt; China Residencies&lt;/a&gt;, giving visitors all the more reason to return over the exhibit’s tenure (through August 2020).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicating power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penn’s Center for Media at Risk launched in 2018, and &lt;em&gt;Meme Tactics&lt;/em&gt; is its first exhibition. This new center seeks to strategize with scholars and media practitioners to “help free/defend/empower/protect/save the media.” This exhibit is a stellar example of how communication strategies like memes can share important messages under threat of political intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-when-where&quot;&gt;WHAT, WHEN, WHERE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meme Tactics: How Artists Innovate Media to Make Unheard Voices Go Viral&lt;/em&gt;. Through August 2020 at the Center for Media at Risk, part of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, 3620 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ascmediarisk.org/&quot;&gt;ascmediarisk.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      I started listening to &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm1rqa7KXfAhWsT98KHU4RA5MQFjAAegQIEhAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mountain-goats.com%2F&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw35T-sWP2rV6EduvthSgIM7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm1rqa7KXfAhWsT98KHU4RA5MQFjAAegQIEhAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mountain-goats.com%2F&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw35T-sWP2rV6EduvthSgIM7&quot;&gt;The Mountain Goats &lt;/a&gt;sometime around junior year of high school. I can’t be sure of exactly when, but I’m pretty sure of how. In 2012, I read &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/em&gt;by John Green; after the finishing the book, I found my way to Green’s other works, including his co-hosted YouTube channel &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/vlogbrothers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/vlogbrothers&quot;&gt;vlogbrothers&lt;/a&gt;. During that year, I watched hundreds of videos from the vlogbrothers channel, getting to know John and his brother, Hank through their various YouTube antics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      John Green is an avid fan of The Mountain Goats, as stated in multiple Q&amp;amp;A videos on the channel and in his use of the band’s music in several tributes. Green’s love of the band was my first introduction to their music, &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://78.media.tumblr.com/733729d6d35bb59166a0941581cb5d26/tumblr_p5uitightd1wlr4zqo1_500.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://78.media.tumblr.com/733729d6d35bb59166a0941581cb5d26/tumblr_p5uitightd1wlr4zqo1_500.jpg&quot;&gt;as it was for many people my age&lt;/a&gt;. From Green’s favorite, &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/41LUI2mXScZDjIZWmvvWpR&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/41LUI2mXScZDjIZWmvvWpR&quot;&gt;“Up the Wolves,”&lt;/a&gt;I listened to the rest of &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/0Cug9j2T7MHK4k8hUEGQ43&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/0Cug9j2T7MHK4k8hUEGQ43&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The Sunset Tree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/2DL7AR6nEM3bhwNy9zHuZa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/2DL7AR6nEM3bhwNy9zHuZa&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Tallahassee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(arguably the band’s best-known work).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      John Darnielle and band have been pretty important to me over the past 6 years:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li style=&quot;list-style-type: none&quot;&gt;
        &lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;
          &lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;
            Led me to my college roommate (we bonded over &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;Tallahassee&lt;/em&gt;)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;
          &lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;
            Provided comfort through ends of relationships &amp;amp; deaths (&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/3B7a3OW9h51WJKYQXD5IAo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/3B7a3OW9h51WJKYQXD5IAo&quot;&gt;“The Mess Inside”&lt;/a&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1V0nScjfbGWAIM0pkacv6V&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1V0nScjfbGWAIM0pkacv6V&quot;&gt;“Your Belgian Things”&lt;/a&gt;will forever make me cry)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--li&quot;&gt;
        Gave me stability moving out of apartments (&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/6kGgTXNw8Q9sOwnl5rgPh5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/6kGgTXNw8Q9sOwnl5rgPh5&quot;&gt;“Genesis 3:23”&lt;/a&gt;) and into new ones (listening to &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/0qiQRfHW1HvMTnYGtYgrtQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/0qiQRfHW1HvMTnYGtYgrtQ&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;Goths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;my first weekend in D.C.)
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      …and most recently, gave me fodder for Twitter bots.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      But we’ll get to that.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;section section--body&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section-divider&quot;&gt;
  &lt;hr class=&quot;section-divider&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section-content&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      What fascinates me most is the sheer amount of content produced by the band. In their 27-year history, there are over 1100 setlists, 600 original songs, 24 members or collaborators, 15 studio albums, 19 EPs, 4 singles (as of today)…and that’s just quantitatively. Their music spans from low-fidelity recordings popular in the 90s to polished full-band numbers; emotionally resonant lyrics like
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--pullquote-em&quot;&gt;“I am drowning, there is no sign of land / You are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hand / And I hope you die / I hope we both die”&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      to the simplistic
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--pullquote-em&quot;&gt;“I love the cows/I love the cows/I love the cows, yeah/I love the cows”&lt;/em&gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      Their career is a collection with datasets, recordings, feelings, and memories — and an extremely complex and impressive collection at that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      I’m not the only one to have seen the possibility for inquiry here. The band’s fandom is well-known for its obsessiveness, and the band’s efforts to establish a relationship and community with their audience.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      As a dataset, the Mountain Goats have served as fodder for many digital projects. Best known is the Kyle Barbour’s &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://annotatedtmg.org/#eps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://annotatedtmg.org/#eps&quot;&gt;The Annotated Mountain Goats&lt;/a&gt;, an early version of Genius-style annotation and referencing for the band’s discography. The &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://themountaingoats.wikia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;http://themountaingoats.wikia.com/&quot;&gt;fan wiki&lt;/a&gt; works in tandem of with Barbour’s project, including a list of every concert they’ve ever performed for each song, as well as John’s discussion of certain songs. &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://archive.org/search.php?query=the%20mountain%20goats&amp;amp;and[]=mediatype%3A%22etree%22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://archive.org/search.php?query=the%20mountain%20goats&amp;amp;and[]=mediatype%3A%22etree%22&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; hosts many live performances. &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.setlist.fm/stats/the-mountain-goats-5bd69b48.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.setlist.fm/stats/the-mountain-goats-5bd69b48.html&quot;&gt;Setlist.fm’s statistics&lt;/a&gt; contain detailed information regarding songs, tours, and covers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      There are two active maps of the discography, highlighting all the locations referenced. &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=40.71395599999998%2C-74.00390600000003&amp;amp;spn=112.486328%2C316.40625&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;oe=UTF8&amp;amp;num=200&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;vpsrc=0&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;mid=1ja7ZHXJm7rNSoLjKndWQJYqRvD8&amp;amp;z=8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=40.71395599999998%2C-74.00390600000003&amp;amp;spn=112.486328%2C316.40625&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;oe=UTF8&amp;amp;num=200&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;vpsrc=0&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;mid=1ja7ZHXJm7rNSoLjKndWQJYqRvD8&amp;amp;z=8&quot;&gt;One focuses on lyrics&lt;/a&gt;, while the other &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=12p2kjgGBYf0N5xj2ME0OJdU6AWI&amp;amp;ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C0&amp;amp;z=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=12p2kjgGBYf0N5xj2ME0OJdU6AWI&amp;amp;ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C0&amp;amp;z=1&quot;&gt;sorts places by type of location&lt;/a&gt;. (Note the clustering in southern California, where Darnielle lived for a time &amp;amp; where the band was formed.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      I’m not even the only one making bots for the band — a &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/lists/the-mountain-goats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/lists/the-mountain-goats&quot;&gt;cursory twitter search&lt;/a&gt;highlights a few.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      Knowing the endless potential for using the Mountain Goats for digital projects, I thought making Twitter bots would be a good use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      I love Twitter bots. I love the creative uses of content for presentation on Twitter — some of them serious (like &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Every3Minutes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Every3Minutes&quot;&gt;@Every3Minutes&lt;/a&gt;) some of them funny (like &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/magicrealismbot?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/magicrealismbot?lang=en&quot;&gt;@MagicRealismBot&lt;/a&gt;), some of them just out there (&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NYT_first_said&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NYT_first_said&quot;&gt;@NYT_first_said&lt;/a&gt;). Despite being procedural and automated, bots have a personality of their own that attract attention and engagement from users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      In &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://killscreen.com/articles/praise-digital-era-obscurity-mountain-goats/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://killscreen.com/articles/praise-digital-era-obscurity-mountain-goats/&quot;&gt;his piece for &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Kill Screen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Daniel Fries highlights the digital-era obscurity of the band: “this digitization of ephemera preserves the work but destroys its transience.” Fries has a point about this, and my projects are no exception. In Élika Ortega’s &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://dsg.neu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/BotsWorkshop.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://dsg.neu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/BotsWorkshop.pdf&quot;&gt;“How To Make a Twitter Bot in 1 hour or less,”&lt;/a&gt; she quotes Leonardo Flores for the potential of bots in codifying bodies of work into algorithms fills them with potential for exploration. Similarly, Allison Parrish notes the uncreative remixing of bots makes them transient once more — it is not the same existence or categorizing of the band each time, but an approach to continually reexamine the text or data. In making the datasets &amp;amp; code that you’ll see below, I have perpetuated the process of digitizing and solidifying the Mountain Goats canon.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      But I also feel that in making Twitter bots, the transient nature of the band’s ephemera is highlighted rather than destroyed. &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://aag.secure-abstracts.com/AAG%20Annual%20Meeting%202018/abstracts-gallery/14349&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://aag.secure-abstracts.com/AAG%20Annual%20Meeting%202018/abstracts-gallery/14349&quot;&gt;Tim Highfield&lt;/a&gt; points out the imagined geographies of Twitter bots as visual interventions within a user’s feed. “Thrown into existence and then gone again,” a bot’s reuse of the material attempts to recreate the disposality of the pre-internet era.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      There’s another point in Fries’s piece that makes me look at Twitter bots as a solution to the balance preservation and transience. Darnielle never plans to make a live album — as Fries extrapolates, Darnielle supports the proliferation of fan versions of the work over the definitive live version he might create. In making bots, I find the reuse and decontextualization actually plays with their transience? A lyric is part of a song, but it is also a connection — the interconnected dataset of making the Mountain Goats canon and then throwing it back into the world again defines that there is no one way to experience the band, the music, or the data. It is ever-changing, momentary, and endlessly exploring what it means to look at this collection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;section section--body&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      The sheer number of songs produced by Darnielle and band means there is a song for basically every occasion. (In fact, it’s a common ask on reddit to come up with a TMG song for a specific situation.) This bot is run by &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/&quot;&gt;Cheap Bots, Done Quick!&lt;/a&gt;. I took the &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/23ae2da2c70db54420bc86994e6702a2d6a60c1a/data/humans/moods.json&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/23ae2da2c70db54420bc86994e6702a2d6a60c1a/data/humans/moods.json&quot;&gt;moods&lt;/a&gt;from &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/dariusk/corpora&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/dariusk/corpora&quot;&gt;Darius Kazemi’s corpora repository&lt;/a&gt;on Github. (Kazemi curated this collection of interesting data for bots and similar projects.) I pulled the list of songs from a few different sources — I used &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://www.themountaingoats.net/cgi-bin/songs.cgi?ACTION=show_all_songs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.themountaingoats.net/cgi-bin/songs.cgi?ACTION=show_all_songs&quot;&gt;the band’s website&lt;/a&gt;as a starting point, but I noticed that they didn’t have the most recent albums. I supplemented the list with Genius records, which includes unreleased music.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      In version 2 (December 2017), I fixed the bot to include Spotify links to the songs, so I can listen straight from the tweet if it’s a song I don’t know. (I did this by hand, but if anyone knows how to automate it, let me know!) A lot of the Mountain Goats songs are unreleased or specific live performances — out of respect to Darnielle and the band, I didn’t include recordings of those in the list. You know of their existence, but you can’t access them unless you’re looking for it — preserving some of the ephemera of the band’s earlier days.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      This bot receives decent traffic, but I’m mostly a fan of when its combinations are wildly accurate/inaccurate. There really is a song for every mood, and more importantly, it’s brought me through the band’s music in a way I might not have intended. With the Spotify link directly in the tweet, I’ve found myself serendipitously working my way to old albums, or songs I’ve never heard.

      Markov chains generate nonsensical text from a given source, attempting to match the text’s style.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      This bot works with a custom Python library &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pygaze.org/2016/03/how-to-code-twitter-bot/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.pygaze.org/2016/03/how-to-code-twitter-bot/&quot;&gt;developed by Edwin Dalmaijer&lt;/a&gt;, with instructions. It took a few tries to get it to work correctly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      Markov chains are fascinating examples of probability. I don’t completely understand the math behind them, but &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/&quot;&gt;this visualization&lt;/a&gt;does a good job of explaining it. These mathematical systems use probability to jump from “state” to “state” — or in the case of lyrics, from word to word based on the likelihood that one would follow the other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      This bot is significantly less popular than the others — I would guess that it requires one to know the band’s lyrics intimately enough to get the joke. I have had a few issues getting suspended for frequent tweeting, so I’ve learned to adjust it.

      Someone introduced me &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Critical Role&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a podcast version of the web series in which professional voice actors play &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt;. Previously, I mostly knew about the game from various pop culture references, and through Darnielle’s own interest (see the stats in his &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://johndarnielle.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;http://johndarnielle.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr bio&lt;/a&gt;).

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      Bards in D&amp;amp;D use the power of music to “inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.” They’re best known for spells like &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Vicious Mockery &lt;/em&gt;(a popular roleplaying action) or the ability to give inspiration (an important bonus action.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      In &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Critical Role&lt;/em&gt;, voice actor Sam Riegel plays a gnome bard known for his endless charm and soaring tenor voice. Riegel made use of his character’s musical inclination to &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.critrolestats.com/scanlansongs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.critrolestats.com/scanlansongs&quot;&gt;make pop culture references&lt;/a&gt;. And one day in hit me — this was a perfect combination of the iconic lyrics of the band combined with the game.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      Version 1 of the bot is pretty simple, still working on the CBDQ model. I’m trying to make something more sophisticated, but I was more concerned with launching the bot than getting into the coding details. There are a lot of moving parts to D&amp;amp;D — races, classes, landscapes, spells, actions, etc.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      I’m particularly proud of this one because the stories function on their own. They are embedded into the mythos of the game, and use all possible combinations to make something fascinating. To me, this is peak Twitter bot goals. You can look at the code &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/tmgdnd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/tmgdnd&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      I follow a handful of twitter bots of mountain goats lyrics — but here’s the thing: people don’t source the lyrics. So then I have to like the quote, search for it, and listen to the song later. I wanted a bot that could do that for me.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      I asked for help from the creator of &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WhereIsMobyDick&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WhereIsMobyDick&quot;&gt;WhereIsMobyDick&lt;/a&gt; to understand how to structure the dataset. I also chose to work with one of the more active lyrics tweeting bots to piggyback off of — &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tmgbot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tmgbot&quot;&gt;tmgbot&lt;/a&gt; has both a significant number of followers and regular updates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      I’m still fine-tuning this bot. The biggest issue here is making sure my dataset &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;exactly &lt;/em&gt;matches that tugboat uses, from punctuation and capitalization to key words, phrases, and spelling. I’m not sure where tmgbot pulls its dataset just yet, but it doesn’t match the key versions out there (nor the one I initially used for faketmglyrics.) The other challenge is working with Python to accomplish the things I want — I’m still learning how to code, and figuring out what errors mean take time. Stay tuned!

      The title of this piece, obviously, comes from the tongue-in-cheek from superfans.

I have so many more in mind — a bot that tweets TMG-related locations like &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/sadtopographies/?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/sadtopographies/?hl=en&quot;&gt;sadtopographies&lt;/a&gt;, a bot that takes TMG lyrics and replaces them with emojis, a bot that makes use of the annotations collected by Barbour &amp;amp; does something cool. I also have ideas of DH-related projects that work with this dataset — can I use topic modeling to look at lyrics across the band’s albums? Can I use StoryMap to follow &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;All Hail West Texas&lt;/em&gt;? Can I make use of existing fan content to build something like &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;A Million Blue Pages? &lt;/em&gt;I have a document filled with GitHub repositories to look at for inspiration, saved Twitter accounts to do something with, and all the time I can devote to side projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
      These bots have gathered a small following, and I’m grateful for the people who have commented, questioned, and responded to the tweets. Most of these bots are just revamped versions of other ones I’ve admired, and made from scraps of code that have been hobbled together from elsewhere. I wouldn’t have been able to build these without the ideas from people like &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://tinysubversions.com/projects/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;http://tinysubversions.com/projects/&quot;&gt;Darius Kazemi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/norareed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/norareed&quot;&gt;Nora Reed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/v21/lists/bots/members&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/v21/lists/bots/members&quot;&gt;George Buckenham&lt;/a&gt;, for starters.

However, my love of Twitter bots, and my involvement in making them, have helped me figure out so much about digital projects and code. I started paying attention to their structure — how to format data, how to work with Twitter’s API, how to make use of Twitter’s affordances. It’s also been a test for working in Python (I legitimately took a class to learn how to make better Twitter bots), exploring Javascript, and understanding myself as a coder. These side projects are helping me figure out personal and professional questions, and doing so in the sort of the way that digital scholarship has taught me to value: figure out what you want to do, and find the tools that will get you there. I’m not learning code or tools for the sake of learning about them, but to make myself a more engaged fan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Readings from &#8217;18 Spring Semester</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/graduate/readings-from-18-spring-semester/"/>
   <updated>2018-05-19T21:18:02-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/readings-from-18-spring-semester</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;More for me than for you: some favorite readings this semester from the three classes I took. Links when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/display/musicgrad/Digital+Media+and+Virtual+Performance+seminar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DIGITAL MEDIA AND VIRTUAL PERFORMANCE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bay-Cheng, Sarah. “Digital Historiography and Performance.” _Theatre Journal _68, no. 4 (December 2016): 507-27. doi:10.1353/tj.2016.0104. &lt;/strong&gt;Bay-Cheng also spoke at Brown this semester about a related project on digital history in museums, which is directly in my wheelhouse. Bay-Cheng’s discussion of the Decision Points Theatre at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum brings up all the right questions about how tech changes the experience and performance of history and history-making.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taylor, T. L. “Finding New Worlds.” In &lt;em&gt;Play Between Worlds: Exploring Online Game Culture&lt;/em&gt;, 1-19. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2009. &lt;/strong&gt;I read chapters 1 &amp;amp; 3, both which were captivating and engaging as introductions to online game culture. I’m still thinking through being a power gamer, the connections between physical and virtual worlds, representation of the self, and being a researcher in these spaces. I need to get a copy of the (physical) book so I can finish the whole thing!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salen, Katie, and Eric Zimmerman. &lt;em&gt;Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals.&lt;/em&gt; Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2004. &lt;/strong&gt;We read a few sections regarding the concept of the “magic circle” in game design, and how a lusory attitude makes it possible for players to follow implicit rules. In particular, I was fascinated by the examples in Chapter 33 of games that explicitly blur these boundaries of the magic circle, and where/how one plays a game. This happened around the same time I was reading other works regarding game fundamentals, and it was fascinating to think about the magic circle in action. How does the magic circle function elsewhere?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gillespie, Tarleton. 2010. “The Politics of ‘Platforms’.” New Media &amp;amp; Society 12(3):347-364. &lt;/strong&gt;I actually read this one in undergrad for a related course on textuality and new media. I made it about halfway through this time before realizing I had read it before! The work is over eight years old at this point, but still relevant to our understanding of online content providers. Gillespie’s definitions of platform and the use of the term for different audiences are extremely helpful in identifying the ways in which platforms continue to shape our relationship with companies and content.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morrison, Elise. 2016. Discipline and Desire: Surveillance Technologies in Performance. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. &lt;/strong&gt;Surveillance? Biometrics? Race? Gender? Art? Performance? Responding to these questions? Chapter 5 of Morrison’s work has it all. I’m mostly fascinated by the range of performances presented in the piece, and how the ways in which we can defend ourselves from surveillance technologies (or play against them) is incredibly difficult depending on what the technologies intend to do to/for us.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miller, Kiri. 2017. Playable Bodies: Dance Games and Intimate Media. New York: Oxford University Press. &lt;/strong&gt;I already wrote my critical annotations &lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyesten.com/2018/04/09/critical-annotation-of-miller-2017/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyesten.com/2018/02/27/critical-annotation-of-miller/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; Kiri’s facilitation of the course and connections to other works helped cement this as one of the readings to which I kept returning. I came into the course knowing very little about bodily interfaces, games, or dance – this book provided a strong introduction and jumping-off point for the other readings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRITICAL APPROACHES TO PRESERVATION AND CULTURAL HERITAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benedict Anderson, “Census, Map, Museum,” in &lt;em&gt;Imagined Communities&lt;/em&gt; (Verso: New York, 1991 [orig 1983]): 163-185. &lt;/strong&gt;I’ve read Anderson before for a few different courses. In the context of cultural heritage, Anderson highlighted the connections between it and nationalism, and the tools that get us there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James E. Young, “The Counter-Monument: Memory against Itself in Germany Today,” &lt;em&gt;Critical Inquiry&lt;/em&gt; 18:2 (Winter, 1992): 267-296. &lt;/strong&gt;Young’s concept of counter-monuments, and their work in Germany to understand who can defend/reshape/recreate/read the memory embedded in memorials walls through artistic, ethical, and historical questions. How do we make monuments that remember events without the nationalist myth taking center stage? How do we make monuments that commemorate without relying solely on memory? How do we make monuments that last?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorge Otero-Pailos, “Experimental Preservation,” &lt;em&gt;Places Journal&lt;/em&gt; (September 2016), 19 pages. https://doi.org/10.22269/160913.&lt;/strong&gt; This one is short enough to read through for a summary. I’m primarily interested this tension between &lt;em&gt;experimentation&lt;/em&gt; and _preservation _within the field, and how preservationists can do both well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Franklin D. Vagnone, &lt;em&gt;The Anarchist’s Guide to Historic House Museums&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Routledge, 2016). &lt;/strong&gt;Vagnone is another book I’ve read previously. I believe that community engagement should be the center of cultural institutions’ work. Finding ways to do that in an institution by both valuing communities and preserving the institution’s materials is a tough balance – one we started to unpack in our course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selections from Max Page, &lt;em&gt;Why Preservation Matters&lt;/em&gt; (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2016). &lt;/strong&gt;Can’t believe I never took advantage of the opportunity to meet Page (or Young, for that matter) while at UMass. Chapter 6’s focus on interpreting difficult places challenges the public notion that historic preservation is about the heroic and beautiful. How do preservationists handle difficult histories?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Mastering the Thumbaround</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/graduate/mastering-the-thumbaround/"/>
   <updated>2018-04-25T10:48:05-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/mastering-the-thumbaround</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pen spinning is about as hard as you think it is, which is to say it is difficult. For my presentation, I am trying to master the &lt;em&gt;thumbaround&lt;/em&gt;, which is the cool pen-twirling move where the pen swings around your thumb and you catch it with index finger. It’s supposedly one of the easier moves to do, and it looks impressive when the pen isn’t flying across the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyesten.com/2018/04/16/self-directed-learning-assignment/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted this to be an opportunity to try and activity  that helped me think about my hands: why I move them, what I’m doing with them, and ways to channel the anxious movement into something artistic or impressive. Taking it on as an assignment has meant I’m trying to do the thumbaround all day long. I sit down once each evening for about 30 minutes watching various videos, but I’m also trying to do it in these empty waiting periods outside of offices and before meetings. Essentially, I’m using my practice as a time to see whether pen-spinning works as I intend it to in my daily life. And so far, it does! While I think about it a bit more than I would playing with my ring or an elastic or just tapping my fingers on the desk, it’s helped me realize the moments in which I’m compelled to move. It’s also helped me think about what it means to _perform _in those moments – what does pen-spinning say about me as a person in comparison to drumming my fingers on the table, or clenching my fist? While no one has commented on it yet, someone must’ve noticed me doing this. What do they think about this performance of social anxiety through pens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pen-spinning has a large online community of practice – so much so that it’s explicitly mentioned on its Wikipedia page. The peer-to-peer networks Miller mentions in _Playing Along _have been crucial to the success/awareness of pen-spinning as something more than just a cool trick. In some ways, amateurs’ use of kinesthetic knowledge have created a foundation for the more “professional” venues of competition and artistry that pen-spinning takes on in other countries. The videos I found on YouTube are almost all amateurs in every way – video production, explanation, content. The more professional ones, coming from competitions or “professionals,” don’t necessarily serve as learning material but rather something to inspire others. And the comments on those videos largely come from people outside the community of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we didn’t talk about in our discussion of communities of practice is who makes up these communities. We have a good idea of who takes on the role of teaching, but less so on who takes up the role of learning. Learning to play guitar online or do yoga or learning to dance is applied to a general public audience. But as a public human, I should know better – public should be defined. So, who else is trying to learn pen spinning? Based on the conversations in the comments and the videos I’ve watched, the audience seems to largely be the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kids: Mostly middle schoolers trying really hard to impress their peers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Procrastinators: People looking for something to do in order to avoid what they should be doing (finals, wedding planning, homework, projects at work, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anime fans: Pen-spinning is an art form in Japan, and many commenters reference seeing it in various animated Japanese shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching the videos has been a challenge in itself. I spent a significant amount of time trying to find a video that a) appeals to me as a user instead of someone like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN4gVyd5PfAIXqv69HCW_1A&quot;&gt;Quinverse&lt;/a&gt;, b) gives me a moment to follow the move instead of jumping right into it, and c) doesn’t immediately reference other moves or videos related to the thumbaround.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have learned, though, are a lot of the basics to getting it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t actually use a pen to start – work with an unsharpened pencil, which helps you understand the maneuver through balance. You want the heavier end of the pen to be the one you are pushing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t focus on the whole move at once. These videos come in two parts: 1) getting the pen around your thumb and 2) catching it. The first part of the video means your pen will be flying everywhere across your room – that’s a good sign! It means you have the momentum to get it around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some commenters suggested &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; looking at your hand while you’re practicing, which has actually been the most helpful advice from these videos. I wanted to learn this skill in the first place to understand what my fingers are doing in these moments of social anxiety, when I’m playing with rings or elastics and not thinking about the movements. Pen-spinning seems to work the same way. When I’m intently focused on what my hands are trying to do, I get increasingly frustrated with my inability to master the move. But when I do it in place of another social anxiety activity, pen-spinning feels natural.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dominant-hand makes a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; difference here. Almost all of the videos I watched focused on right-handed users, with vague suggestions of how it would work for the left hand. For the record, I did try to switch to my left hand, which further defamiliarized myself with that interface. Whereas my right hand already knew how to hold a pen, my left hand seems totally lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the videos mentioned that it took the three months to master the thumbaround, which does not bode well for my final demonstration. However, I’m practicing a lot and seem to be getting somewhere! In any case, I’ve mastered the art of demonstrating the set-up for a thumbaround &amp;amp; how to teach it to others.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Self-Directed Learning Assignment</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/graduate/digital-media-and-virtual-performance/self-directed-learning-assignment/"/>
   <updated>2018-04-16T18:33:27-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/digital-media-and-virtual-performance/self-directed-learning-assignment</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m not a very fidgety person, except for with my hands. I wear rings on my fingers so that I always have something to play with, I’ll often wrap hair elastics around my wrist for a quick play toy in class, and I mindlessly take apart paper clips in order to meld them into new shapes. Something about the stimulation for spinning and fidgeting around fingers keeps me focused on other things, though I’ve never really thought about what I’m doing or how my body does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my self-directed learning assignment, I want to delve into the use of my fingers more deeply in the art of pen-spinning. Like DDR and the dancing game studies we’ve studied, there is a level of expertise associated with pen-spinning beyond the mindlessly activity we might do in a meeting or in the classroom. As a form of contact juggling, there is an intense skill involved while also considering the performance elements and art form behind the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m partially excited by the novelty of learning such an activity, but also delving into the direction of my hand movement. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered if “trained” dancers have the same problem with kinesthetic vision in video games as inexperienced players, or if their training encourages a different engagement with the avatars at play. Do dancers comment on the movement itself, the ways in which it feels (un)comfortable or uses(lacks) particular skill? Would they pick up on the scrolling flashcards or the game’s sensor apparatus more quickly, being used to the acting as sensors themselves in context of a stage or other dancers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also curious to know how kinesthetic vision works here as opposed to non-kinesthetic vision in other gaming experiences. In introductory levels of video games, the point is very much for new players to figure out the interface: how the controller affects the avatar, how the avatar can move within its virtual environment, the various ratings/scores/achievements being tracked by the game. So it doesn’t entirely surprise me that new and inexperienced players didn’t pick up on these things. Here, the biggest difference is the interface of the body, and so the (un)comfortability or confusion in brought into the physical world of the player. I would like to probe that idea more – what is it about the disruption (or blurring) between the virtual and the physical environments that kinesthetic vision does for _Dance Central? _Especially in these moments of discomfort with racial masquerade, is there something that the game is doing that doesn’t go on in clubs, parties, or other physical counterparts? What about the manufactured conversation between the player and their attempts to mimic the avatar encourages this discomfort or movement?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Practice Reflection #2: Show Choir, GLEE, and Learning to Dance Again</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/graduate/practice-reflection-2-show-choir-glee-and-learning-to-dance-again/"/>
   <updated>2018-04-03T22:31:54-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/practice-reflection-2-show-choir-glee-and-learning-to-dance-again</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I danced in show choir for three years in high school, though I really saw it as an opportunity to sing more than to move. I would come home from dance retreat weekends extremely sore, thinking about moving my body in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came time to practice for the digital dance circulation assignment, I thought back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/cvAqAVYRHO4&quot;&gt;the dozens of show choir videos&lt;/a&gt; that recorded our performances over the years. I never actually watched these at the time, and I thought it would be a great challenge to use myself as an example of a dance in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching myself dance in video highlighted lot of things in relation to my own body that I hadn’t considered while onstage. For one, it took me a minute to find myself in the performance – the videographer clearly wanted to capture one of my friends, and so it’s intended less as an instructional video and more as a performance. But I started to think of these dance movements as something separate from the music, or the performance, or the experience of being onstage. Here, it really became an opportunity to think of my body as an interface, and movement solely as movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of choreography, I found myself drawn to the girls’ part immediately – after all, that’s what I did for 9 months onstage. Some of this was actually kind of familiar and easy to replicate. (Like this move, which I still occasionally burst into when I’m bored, because it’s basically second-nature at this point.) But it was much more challenging to try out the guys’ movements – not only because I hadn’t done them, but in that they feel explicitly gendered. Girls shimmy and shake, flounce and twirl, showing off their dresses. The guys, on the other hand, are often much more rigid with their movements. Most of them were pretty uncomfortable dancing, and it shows when you try and retranslate that onto your own body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also curious about what of this is choreographed, and how much of this choreography was our own. So much of this about what we each added onto the performance – paying attention to the facial expressions, the way we move from dot to dot, or prepare for the next major mark. Thinking about what was choreographed and what was improvised, I wondered how the context of re-performing elements of a recorded performance highlights these details. What does the change in interface and purpose do for this experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kathrin Peters’ and Andrea Seier’s “Home Dance: Mediacy and Aesthetics of the Self on YouTube,” the authors delve into media apparatuses as spaces of revelation. In my remediation &amp;amp; recording of the historical home video (which, essentially, is what the show choir video was), what kind of statement was I making in my remake? What are you seeing of me in my sweatpants, copying the moves of my younger self? Is there a transgression here? And what is transgression saying about me – learning from my formal self, perhaps making fun of me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the show choir theme, I immediately thought of how I first encountered Beyonce’s viral choreography. Watching &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt; is the first &amp;amp; only distinct memory I have of watching the “Single Ladies” dance, despite the show airing almost a year after the video’s premiere. (I was not very hip on pop culture back then.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt; is something of a remake and reenactment in itself – of every pop culture reference of 2009 to 2015, of Broadway showtunes, surviving for the most part on parody. The whole episode revolves around “Single Ladies” as a plot point, in which sophomore Kurt tries out for the football team to impress his father and cover for recording himself. So, three major performances of the choreography: 1) at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGFKtzZBi9g&quot;&gt;the episode’s beginning&lt;/a&gt;, in which Kurt records himself dancing to Single Ladies with two friends, and 2) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9IRaHOF30k&quot;&gt;Kurt’s “audition” for the football team&lt;/a&gt;, and 3) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3LxQfkQVjo&quot;&gt;the night of the big game&lt;/a&gt;, in which they use “Single Ladies” to distract the other team. (There is _a lot _to be said about this in terms of social dance, mediacy and aesthetics of the self, but that would be a totally different reflection.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched through the three videos, all fairly short in length, thinking about what I was learning about “Single Ladies” and bodily interfaces by watching each of them. In trying to move through the gender dynamics back onto me &amp;amp; my interface, I couldn’t help but think of the class conversations about gender performance in the &lt;em&gt;Dance Central&lt;/em&gt; games. The episode hinges on the gimmick of the stereotypical football players dancing to the song, juxtaposed with Kurt’s flamboyance in the first two videos. In performing Kurt’s rendition of the dance, I found myself embodying his character more so than the dance movements – his obvious transgressions in his bedroom as a closeted gay man performing the popular song, his nervousness and yet subtle confidence in preparing for the field goal. When performing as the football players, on the other hand, I found myself pretending to be wearing the heavy uniform and gyrating appropriately for that kind of bodily interface. In reference to what this says about “Single Ladies,” kept thinking of Sydney’s question in class with some of comics/memes: “Can someone explain the joke to me here?” Once I started performing as the football players, the joke or premise seemed less obvious. When it came down to thinking of “Single Ladies” not as a song but as a specific set of movements, my association with the choreography on some level has always been tied up in this performance of gender. What does it do to “Single Ladies” when the remediation moves through this feminine-masculine-feminine transition of style, from body to body, until you reach my own again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in both cases, I had the strangest feeling of bonding with the questions of privacy, spectatorship, and intimacy of digital dance from Kiri Miller’s chapter in &lt;em&gt;Playable Bodies&lt;/em&gt;. I found myself so uncomfortable with the idea of performing these movements publicly (or privately for my webcam), and even embarrassed by the idea of doing them in my own room. But seven years ago, I was doing these movements in public, for the purpose they intended! In this case, the surveillance technology was the blinking green light on my laptop that I used to record myself. What was embarrassing about this particular situation that wasn’t embarrassing seven years before?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really appreciated Foster’s historical review of the term &lt;em&gt;choreography&lt;/em&gt; and the corresponding role of the choreographer: from documentation/documenter to something more like what we associate a choreographer with today. In the museum field, the terms &lt;em&gt;curation&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;curator&lt;/em&gt; have a similar ubiquity by the general public, which challenges us to consider the specificity and detail of activity of the curatorial process: what is being curated? what is involved in curation? what is the role of curator? While not considered an embodied practice like choreography, there is some element to the conversation around curation that acknowledges the explicitly constructed/mediated experience through which we select, organize, present, interpret, etc. And so I wonder further what genealogical analysis might need to be done in order to “curate empathy,” and what word might replace &lt;em&gt;kinesthesia&lt;/em&gt; in that process. Furthermore, how does participatory culture or new media platforms further the work of curating empathy in a way that make us consider that makes that term so commonly used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building off Foster’s central question on page 1 (“in what ways do these responses form part of or otherwise influence how we experience dancing and how we derive significance from it?”), I’m curious to know what we might say regarding these changing definitions of &lt;em&gt;choreography&lt;/em&gt; that allow us to think about structuring movement. If choreography refers to structuring of movement – both as action and process – what are the different emotional contexts that can arise from it? And what does choreography/choreographing do to our reactions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller, Kiri. &lt;em&gt;Playable Bodies: Dance Games and Intimate Media.&lt;/em&gt; New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2017: 43.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time circling the words related to demands by the Kinect in order for you to assume the role of the controller: &lt;em&gt;make sure, requires, have to&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;confirming&lt;/em&gt;. You cannot completely resist the technology in order to play the game –you are consciously being coached the entire time. It places some trust in you, and you in it as you work together to operate under the “traditional” gaming standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are you commanded to perform in order for the game to work properly, but you are also evaluated and scored on that system. There is a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; way to perform here, and your performance is quantified. The photographic freeze-frame images show proof of your body-as-controller post-performance, for you to now break the magic circle and acknowledge how you trusted the game.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out of the chapter as a whole thinking primarily about the role of trust in performance, and in what ways that changes in gaming technologies like the Kinect. As a performer, one assumes a level of trust from the audience, from other performers, from the physical setting in order to perform. Here, and in the article from Pham regarding virtual fitting rooms, people are a lot more comfortable with a technological apparatus assuming this role – but in some ways, the trust is being relearned in this relationship. You’re being taught to actively avoid thinking about how you trust the Kinect in your performance by staring at the screen, while also being trained in how to perform for the sensor (as in, what is right or wrong performance.)  Are there analogies to this in traditional performance structures? Or is this an element of trust from gaming?&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/interview-with-women-and-technology-at-brown</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Maddie Mott at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.brown.edu/womenandtech/2018/02/19/interview-emily-esten-digital-humanist-and-public-humanities-graduate-student/&quot;&gt;Women and Technology at Brown&lt;/a&gt; about my experience in digital public humanities &amp;amp; my work as a graduate student in the university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) How do you define digital public humanities? What is most exciting about the field to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I think of digital public humanities more as a framework than a field. If public humanities is a field interfacing and engaging with communities, digital public humanities provides methodology and questions for bringing technology to that conversation. How does technology change the way we perform research, interpret cultural heritage, or communicate with publics?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Part of what I love about digital public humanities is that it’s so nebulous – and often, the people I think who are doing this kind of work see themselves first as makers, creators, artists, librarians, or scholars. Rarely do you ever see someone describe themselves solely as a digital humanist! There are so many entry points for this work, and I like connecting the dots, finding areas of focus, and developing the critical thinking skills to build and analyze digital projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Practice Reflection #1: Meditation Apps</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/graduate/practice-reflection-1-meditation-apps/"/>
   <updated>2018-02-19T15:43:32-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/practice-reflection-1-meditation-apps</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As someone who fell out of meditative practice, the idea of jumping back into it for class felt intimidating. What I enjoyed about the practice – the communal aspect, the physical grounding in a space, the long, reflective state – would all be gone in working alongside the apps we were tasked with for class. But I dive in with interest, considering our conversations around virtual-physical relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;  wp-image-10057 alignleft&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-14-pm.png?resize=196%2C231&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2018-02-19 at 3.45.14 PM&quot; width=&quot;196&quot; height=&quot;231&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-14-pm.png?w=600&amp;amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-14-pm.png?resize=254%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1 254w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt; Starting out with Headspace, I’m immediately reminded of why I don’t like pre-recorded mediations in the first place. The 5 or 10-minute recording is a poor simulation of the real thing. I can feel the time pass – I know when Andy is going to speak again, I know roughly what he’s going to say. The actions of my body-as-interface and Andy’s disembodied commands creates a false sense of interactivity. Andy isn’t so much responding to my input as he is assuming my input; my body isn’t so much responding to Andy as it is acknowledging what he’s saying and maybe following along. As I start each 5-minute experience, I feel an active resistance to not follow the instructions – to not close my eyes, scan my body, or count breaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Headspace experience structures your participation, slowly incorporating the practice into your day into a “journey” before you can unlock the app’s library. It sends notifications throughout the day, inserting itself into my life in unintended ways. We often think of the physical intruding on our virtual experiences – lag in &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt;, prior knowledge of individual people characters in &lt;em&gt;EverQuest&lt;/em&gt; – but here the boundary works differently. I am being reminded of my relationship with the virtual in my physical existence, Headspace commanding me to be calm or relax or to mindful &lt;em&gt;now.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;  wp-image-10056 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-09-pm.png?resize=504%2C157&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2018-02-19 at 3.45.09 PM&quot; width=&quot;504&quot; height=&quot;157&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-09-pm.png?w=1422&amp;amp;ssl=1 1422w, https://i2.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-09-pm.png?resize=300%2C94&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-09-pm.png?resize=768%2C240&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-09-pm.png?resize=1024%2C320&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole meditative experience starts to feel transactional by day 10, these notifications included, and so I start to think more broadly about where our interfaces fail to meet. Is it the auditory interaction with Andy that’s not working for me? Is it the direction of his script, its consistency? Is it these notifications, feeling uncomfortable about my investment in Headspace as one that seeks to explore the interfaces of mind and body?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;  wp-image-10058 alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-49-pm.png?resize=152%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2018-02-19 at 3.45.49 PM&quot; width=&quot;152&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-49-pm.png?w=588&amp;amp;ssl=1 588w, https://i2.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-49-pm.png?resize=164%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1 164w, https://i2.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-19-at-3-45-49-pm.png?resize=559%2C1024&amp;amp;ssl=1 559w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt; Switching to Silent Habit, this transactional feeling of performance and interface is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; commercialized. Here, I have some level of customization I was looking for from Andy and Headspace The “journey” options for new users seem endless. In addition to an ON THE GO option, the home page of the app features multiple topics, teachers, and recordings to which I can listen. For Valentine’s Day alone, I could listen to dozens of customized entries: feeling single and happy, feeling alone, mindful relationships, before a date. Who needs a meditation that specific? Where is the &lt;em&gt;simple habit&lt;/em&gt; in that customization, in that feeling?  I don’t feel that I am able to transcend the virtual or escape the day-to-day; rather, Simple Habit instead seeks to augment my physical world by tailoring each experience to the truth that exists here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the tech subsumes me in a way I didn’t intend. I start out listening just before I go to sleep – and find myself lost in thought, going in and out for ten or fifteen minutes instead of the original five. Is Simple Habit even facilitating anymore? Have I slipped into a totally physical environment? Or perhaps I have flipped into the virtual without realizing it? Is the interface of my body totally in sync with Simple Habit in a way Headspace never quite achieved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a week, I try out a few of these different experiences. I follow Anne Douglas, a life-coach and yoga therapist, as she directs me to sleep better. Kate James talks me through feelings of loneliness and mindful relationships. Someone unnamed woman joins me on my walking commute to campus. I start to think of these listening moments less as moments of meditation, and more like watching YouTube or scrolling through Twitter – they are a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rethinking my initial hesitation to engage with meditation apps, I try to identify more clearly my issues with the prerecordings on either app. It cannot be the script itself – I’m comfortable with the concept of meditation, with body as interface, responding to the commands of another. If we go by the definition from Marie-Laure Ryan, I have taken on virtual control of the body in any practice or technology that has aimed to expand the sensorium.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; To say I don’t like Andy or Anne or Kate shows my bias against the apps .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hesitant to play the &lt;em&gt;capitalism&lt;/em&gt; card, and think of the commodification of this relationship, though there’s an element of that as well. Just as Boellstorff notes &lt;em&gt;Second Life’s&lt;/em&gt; goals of immersion for profit, both apps capitalize on the incorporation of meditation into daily life. But while Headspace recognizes this investment as the relationship between the self and the body, Simple Habit focuses on meditation as an augmentation of the physical world – meditation for a larger purpose/topic/day-to-day. Neither is truly an escape, but a focus on embodiment and virtual control for a profitable cause. And it feels like a violation for Headspace and Simply Habit to wield mindfulness in this way. Can it even really be mindfulness if it’s not acknowledging the capitalistic process that makes it so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of my frustrations lay back in this conversation around interactivity and liveness. What I enjoyed about my past experiences in meditation were its physical manifestations: working together with the guide and the community to get into position, to feel a personal element to the space in which we’re inhabiting, to have bodies work as interfaces together in order to fuel a moment. What about Headspace is interactive other than pressing a button? I could play it as I please and no one would be the wiser. I never have to really participate, or even enter the “magic circle” of the game of meditation for the app to do its work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that I enjoy about the live “performance” of meditation is lost in the mediatized meditative experience on these apps. The “recorded liveness” feels fake when you can see how many times a recording has been played, or the commenters who have used it. If we follow the ideas of performing liveness as discussed in Fritsch and Strötgen, the meditation apps lack the ability to authenticate my expectations. There’s no image-based element to reinforce the implied experience from the guiding voices, and the body’s refusal to directly participate most of the time removes the crucial element of perception of the playing body (59).  But are there ways to make that performance live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boellstorff, Tom. &lt;em&gt;Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human.&lt;/em&gt; Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015: 114.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with presence and immersion through communication stuck out to me as one of the key debates in Boellstorff that hadn’t occurred to me. In other conversations around VR/AR, immersion has so often been the goal of these projects – to the point where users no longer recognize/acknowledge the medium in which it takes place. &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; is neither VR nor AR, but it challenged me to think about the definition of &lt;em&gt;immersion&lt;/em&gt; being formed by sensory experiences as one that hinders this larger debate. Why do we consider that the “goal” of many virtual worlds, and is that a fair way to review the cultures/worlds that are produced inside?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on our conversations from last week around anonymity, authenticity, and boundary-making, I thought it fascinating to consider residents’ language around the use of voice in &lt;em&gt;Second Life.&lt;/em&gt; For many, the immersion comes from establishing those boundaries, not erasing them. (See circling of &lt;em&gt;extension, reminder, blur, break.&lt;/em&gt;) The words I didn’t circle were the emotionally-charged reactions: &lt;em&gt;destroy, doom, ruin.&lt;/em&gt; I sympathize with these sorts of reactions, though I was particularly struck by Kimmy’s notion of “the whole tone of his voice” being recognizable after using the microphone. As someone who’s often told I’m difficult to read through text, there was something really sweet (or sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet) about being able to recognize those kinds of nuances in another person’s language. In a world where text is the primary (and only) mode of communication, how much more nuanced is the language of &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; in ways that Boellstorff doesn’t discuss here for world-building?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wondered what boundaries would be further highlighted by using voice in &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the international dimensions of the game (which Boellstorff gets into earlier on in the page as well as the conversation around time and Euro residents);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the purposes of people playing the game (social implications as referenced in the note “the tech in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.limetownstories.com/&quot;&gt;Limetown&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;” a fictional podcast about a neuroscience research facility gone horribly wrong. Are there examples of virtual worlds where this has happened?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the privileged nature of senses in virtual worlds in general (the fact that tech invests &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much in visual experiences, and how sound often becomes secondary to that.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What other boundaries or the virtual/actual would come forth in using voice in these spaces?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>#BearToursByEmily: Rating the Public Art of Brown University’s Mascot</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/beartoursbyemily-rating-the-public-art-of-brown-universitys-mascot/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@sheishistoric/beartoursbyemily-rating-the-public-art-of-brown-universitys-mascot-f4fa7ecdbce2&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
  When I walk between the Nightingale-Brown House and the Rockefeller Library, I walk right by the Maddock Alumni Center. Every time I passed, a statue caught my eye. It doesn’t stand out enough from its surroundings to bring alarm, and it isn’t quite visible from the streets. But you can tell something is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. I finally took a moment from my daily trek to take a closer look at this…figure.&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;graf graf--figure&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/78d18-1pottr4fcvynrndm05vibjq.png?w=700&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt; &lt;figcaption class=&quot;imageCaption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--figure-strong&quot;&gt;Unnamed&lt;/strong&gt;, Nicholas Swearer (1988)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
  The mascot of Brown University is bear — a bear named Bruno, to be exact. And this is just one of several representations of the bear on campus. Over the course of October 2017, I shared the campus bear sculptures on my private Instagram account under the hashtag #beartoursbyemily.&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#_ftn2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; Ratings were given on a scale of 0 (worst) to 5 (best), solely on the criteria of whether or not I liked it. (This came under criticism from &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; people, who thought my ratings were unfounded and subjective. To which I say, do your own ratings!) I’m fascinated by art on college campuses anyway — you can always find at least one thought-provoking piece or representation of a mascot.&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#_ftn3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The prominence of the bear at Brown gave me something to chase down, take interest, and curate my way through campus public art. I identified five bears.&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#_ftn4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;graf graf--figure&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/c4425-1gimqoe-uu1ihjcwqywjoaa.png?w=700&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt; &lt;figcaption class=&quot;imageCaption&quot;&gt;Your fearless tour guide interpreting the first statue. (I KNOW, I’m wearing a different school’s hat.)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
  Around the same time I took interest in the campus bear statues, I came across the exhibit, “The Brown Bear: A History.”&lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#_ftn5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The exhibit’s &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://library.brown.edu/create/brownbearhistory/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;digital presence&lt;/a&gt; is a great review on the history of Brown’s mascot. Divided into six chronological sections over the twentieth century, Mackie took viewers from the push for the bear mascots in the first place, the live bears that once graced campus, all the way to the mascot as ambassador of the campus in athletic and community events.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
  Borrowing from Mackie’s collected histories, as well as Martha Mitchell’s &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia Brunonina&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve developed a tour script. This tour takes you through the campus and artistic histories of each artwork, and includes my original and updating ratings of the bears. Since I’ve had some time to really think through the ratings, the bears are now judged on the following criteria for a final scale from 1(worst) -10 (best).
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;Backstory:&lt;/strong&gt; What’s the history of this particular statue/sculpture? How did it end up at Brown or this particular location?
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;Quality of bear:&lt;/strong&gt; What kind of bear is this? And is of artistic merit?
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the viewer’s subjective reaction to the bear? What kind of conversation does it generate for campus goers?
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong&quot;&gt;University spirit:&lt;/strong&gt; What does it say as a representation of the Brown mascot? If the University is to embody this bear, what qualities does it instill or celebrate for the campus community?
&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;graf graf--p&quot;&gt;
  I’m no art or bear expert — I’m simply someone who spent way too much time thinking about #beartoursbyemily and wanted to give some justification to the time I spent wandering around campus. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Here’s the working result.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fantastic Places, Unhuman Humans: 4 Lessons from TAing Online</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In spring 2017, I served as a teaching assistant for “Fantastic Places, Unhuman Humans,” Brown’s first ever online-only general education course in the humanities. In this gamified course, students follow a humanoid’s curiosity about what it means to be human through the use of literary analysis. In addition to weekly readings, students completed cafes (discussion forums) and quests (close readings, papers, visualizations, or fun assignments!) In addition to the conceptual questions around humanity and nature, the technical skills of close readings and literary analysis, we also wanted students to think about the creative opportunities to engage with literature and express new viewpoints from the readings. Along the way, students had the option to earn skill badges and levels to 1) highlight achievement throughout the course and b) take on new opportunities or challenges.​&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s what I learned.​&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Revisualizing the Crystal Palace: Cataloging History, Part 4</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/graduate/revisualizing-the-crystal-palace-cataloging-history-part-4/"/>
   <updated>2018-01-06T12:02:30-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/revisualizing-the-crystal-palace-cataloging-history-part-4</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Co-written with Steven Lubar on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lubar/revisualizing-the-crystal-palace-d239e50d9e12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Cataloging History” is a four-part series on the history and theory of museum and exhibition catalogs, focusing on the 1853 New York Crystal Palace. This final installment applies the tools of the digital humanities to explore the Crystal Palace catalogs as digital object. What can we do when we turn the catalog into a database?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id=&quot;f5fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;
  One of the many souvenirs available at the New York Crystal Palace was a build-it-yourself wood model. Open the box, arrange the blocks, and you could build your own miniature Crystal Palace. In this final installment of “Cataloging History,” you too can build your own Crystal Palace, but digitally, by moving bits, not bits of wood, around. What can a digital model tell us?
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id=&quot;32ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
  William Richards’ job as catalog editor was to think hard about the best way to arrange the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Official Catalog&lt;/em&gt;, knowing that once he made that decision, it couldn’t be changed. The catalog would be printed, the data in it frozen into the arrangement he decided upon. But now the ice has melted. We have freed the data, turned it from a printed book into a database. It has come back to life. It can be analyzed, represented in new ways. It can be searched, sorted, faceted, mapped, turned into networked and nodes. &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LG5YEfdegOUA7cclRkXT0GzqZ7uLKAP4I7wzP8l5PfU/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The database is here,&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to follow along.

   <title>Readings From Fall &#8217;17 Semester</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/graduate/readings-from-fall-17-semester/"/>
   <updated>2017-12-22T12:03:24-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/readings-from-fall-17-semester</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;More for me than for you: some favorite readings this semester across the three classes I took. Links when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.brown.edu/amst-2220j-s01-2017-fall/&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL RACE THEORY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crenshaw, K. (1991). Mapping the margins: Intersectionality, identity politics, and violence against women of color. &lt;em&gt;Stanford law review&lt;/em&gt;, 1241-1299. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039&quot;&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039&lt;/a&gt;. – &lt;/strong&gt;Why you can’t just throw around the term &lt;em&gt;intersectionality,&lt;/em&gt; but also exploring what that means for the institutions that perpetuate violence.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexander, M. (2012). &lt;em&gt;The new Jim Crow: Mass incarceration in the age of colorblindness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; – Totally slept on this and was pretty excited about finally having a chance to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Williams Jr, R. A. (1997). Vampires anonymous and critical race practice. &lt;em&gt;Michigan Law Review&lt;/em&gt;, 741-765. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1290045&quot;&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1290045&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – I went into Prof. Keene’s office after reading this and talked about how amazing it is! I think it sums up a lot of my feelings on academia in general, and why public humanities feels like a better fit for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuck, E., &amp;amp; Yang, K. W. (2012). Decolonization is not a metaphor. &lt;em&gt;Decolonization: Indigeneity, education &amp;amp; society&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;(1). &lt;a href=&quot;http://decolonization.org/index.php/des/article/download/18630/15554&quot;&gt;http://decolonization.org/index.php/des/article/download/18630/15554.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Again, another article that is referenced all the time and I have totally missed. Thinking of the popularity of decolonizing, especially in the current moment, and how to address what that actually means in context.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bergerson, A. A. (2003). Critical race theory and white racism: Is there room for white scholars in fighting racism in education? &lt;em&gt;Qualitative Studies in Education&lt;/em&gt;, 16(1), 51-63. – &lt;/strong&gt;Short answer: no. Long answer: maybe?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salis Reyes, Nicole Alia. 2017. A Space for Survivance: Locating Kānaka Maoli through the Resonance and Dissonance of Critical Race Theory. &lt;em&gt;Race Ethnicity and Education, &lt;/em&gt;(In Press). &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1080/13613324.2017.1376632&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/13613324.2017.1376632 .&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1080/13613324.2017.1376632&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;  &lt;/a&gt;– In general, reading various offshoots of CRT. I found this one particularly relevant in the discussions around Mauna Kea and the TMT, and well-articulated in its connection between the Hawaiian language and CRT tenets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yosso, T. J. (2005). Whose culture has capital? A critical race theory discussion of community cultural wealth. &lt;em&gt;Race ethnicity and education&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;8&lt;/em&gt;(1), 69-91. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artslb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Whose-culture-has-capital-A-critical-race-theory-discussion-of-community-cultural-wealth-Tara-Yosso.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.artslb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Whose-culture-has-capital-A-critical-race-theory-discussion-of-community-cultural-wealth-Tara-Yosso.pdf.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artslb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Whose-culture-has-capital-A-critical-race-theory-discussion-of-community-cultural-wealth-Tara-Yosso.pdf&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Just saw this referenced &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NJKOeJfTyn&quot;&gt;in another article&lt;/a&gt;. – Particularly valuable for anyone planning to work with communities (and “seeking out” communities of color.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stovall, D. O. (2004). School leader as negotiator: Critical Race Theory, praxis, and the creation of productive space. Multicultural Education, 12(2), 8-12. &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ781916.pdf&quot;&gt;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ781916.pdf.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ781916.pdf&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;– My copy is all marked up with public humanities connections!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fall2017digitalpublichumanities.jimmcgrath.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DIGITAL PUBLIC HUMANITIES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/14/magazine/the-net-is-a-waste-of-time.html&quot;&gt;The Net Is A Waste of Time&lt;/a&gt;” (Gibson)&lt;/strong&gt; – coming off a summer of reading early sci-fi, Gibson made SO much more sense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/83&quot;&gt;Public, First&lt;/a&gt;” (Brennan); “&lt;a href=&quot;http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/75&quot;&gt;Lessons on Public Humanities from the Civic Sphere&lt;/a&gt;” (Hsu)&lt;/strong&gt;, which should definitely be read together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theawl.com/2015/02/all-my-blogs-are-dead/&quot;&gt;All My Blogs Are Dead&lt;/a&gt;” (Maness)&lt;/strong&gt; – more relevant now following the end of The Gothamist and Storify.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.provlib.org/hot-pursuit/downloads/Hot_Pursuit_readable.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lizard Ramone in Hot Pursuit: A Guide to Archives for Artists and Makers &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Ferris) – &lt;/strong&gt;I want all archives to think about developing projects like this for the new(er) audiences they serve.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://nowviskie.org/2016/alternate-futures-usable-pasts/&quot;&gt;alternate futures/usable pasts&lt;/a&gt;” (Nowviskie)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://nowviskie.org/handouts/DH/10rules.pdf&quot;&gt;Ten Rules for Humanities Scholars New to Project Management&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; (Nowviskie) – new rules to live by&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/2/000209/000209.html&quot;&gt;#transform(ing)DH Writing and Research: An Autoethnography of Digital Humanities and Feminist Ethics&lt;/a&gt;” (Bailey)&lt;/strong&gt; – also new rules to live by.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/on-archivy/im-leaving-the-archival-profession-it-s-better-this-way-ed631c6d72fe&quot;&gt;I’m Leaving The Archival Profession: It’s Better This Way&lt;/a&gt;” (Drake)&lt;/strong&gt; – on professionalization, change, and institutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century U.S. History (Survey), conveniently in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/942476994259820544&quot;&gt;image form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric J. Chaput, “’The Rhode Island Question’: The Career of a Debate,” Rhode Island History 68 (Summer/Fall 2010): 47–76.&lt;/strong&gt; – Growing up so close to Rhode Island, I remember researching the Dorr Rebellion at some point during my childhood. We started off the class with this one (which was good pedagogically as students in Rhode Island and to set up the major conflicts discussed throughout the course.) We kept returning to the Dorr War in various conversations over the semester, and the Dorr War as centerpiece really helped me consider the course through this outlook.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raul Coronado, &lt;em&gt;A World Not to Come: A History of Latino Writing and Print Culture&lt;/em&gt; (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2013). – &lt;/strong&gt;Thinking again about speculative futures, intellectual histories, and connections with geography.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Lowe, “History Hesitant,” Social Text 33 (December 2015): 85–107. &lt;/strong&gt;– Read in combination with Coronado (but also with CRT), Lowe feels much more present in our arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Jaffee, A New Nation of Goods: The Material Culture of Early America (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010). &lt;/strong&gt;I think this is the third time I’ve read this book for a class now? Still learning new things each time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caitin Rosenthal, “Slavery’s Scientific Management: Masters and Managers,” in Slavery’s Capitalism: A New History of American Economic Development, eds. Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2016): 62–86. &lt;/strong&gt;– To be honest, I didn’t read the title of the article before reading. I wrote SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT in big letters after the first or second paragraph before realizing my error. Particularly interesting from the technological standpoint, but also interested in reading the rest of the book.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Megan Kate Nelson, Ruin Nation: Destruction and the American Civil War (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2012). – &lt;/strong&gt;Only knew Nelson from Twitter, really appreciated the opportunity to sit down and match her online work with print scholarship! Formed the basis of my thoughts on spatial history for the final paper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amy Dru Stanley, “Slave Emancipation and the Revolutionizing of Human Rights,” in The World the Civil War Made, eds. Gregory P. Downs and Kate Masur, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2015), 269–303. &lt;/strong&gt;– How do we articulate human rights? I have never heard about the Supplementary Civil Rights Act, and found this larger debate regarding the extent of state sovereignty/liberties fascinating. Again, another book of which I’m hoping to read the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>The Degrassi Franchise on the Teenage Experience</title>

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;//the-artifice.com/degrassi-franchise-teenage-experience/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Artifice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The classic Canadian teen drama franchise has been on and off the air for the past thirty-seven years. One of the longest running scripted television series in history, Known for its slogan, “It Goes There,” the &lt;em class=&quot;tle&quot;&gt;Degrassi&lt;/em&gt;franchise has tackled major topics in teenage culture, taboo (date rape, drug abuse, abortion) and overdone (crushes, first dates.) Created by executive producers Kit Hood and Linda Schuyler, the &lt;em class=&quot;tle&quot;&gt;Degrassi&lt;/em&gt; universe started as after-school specials dealing with normal teen issues. As Ben Neihart wrote for &lt;em class=&quot;tle&quot;&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, the kid characters of &lt;em class=&quot;tle&quot;&gt;Degrassi&lt;/em&gt; “without much help from parents and teachers…try to figure out their lives, and kid viewers around the world second-guess them.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-artifice.com/degrassi-franchise-teenage-experience/#note-111713-1&quot; title=&quot;Ben Neihart, “DGrassi Is tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD!” The New York Times Magazine, March 20, 2005, accessed August 22, 2017, http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/20/magazine/dgrassi-is-tha-best-teen-tv-n-da-wrld.html?mcubz=0&amp;amp;_r=0.&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;{#return-note-111713-1.simple-footnote} Known for its casting of real teenagers as opposed to college-age actors in their twenties, the drama-filled franchise spoke to a generation of Canadians growing up – and around the world as well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What I Learned During My Summer Practicum: On Escape, Reevaluation, and Being a Public Human</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/graduate/what-i-learned-during-my-summer-practicum-on-escape-reevaluation-and-being-a-public-human/"/>
   <updated>2017-10-16T11:30:15-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/what-i-learned-during-my-summer-practicum-on-escape-reevaluation-and-being-a-public-human</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To finish off my summer practicum, I had to put together a presentation of five things I learned. As I was doing this, I realized that the most important things I learned were the things that I already knew. And more importantly, I realized that &lt;strong&gt;I am a public human.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me back up: Grad school is hard. By the end of last semester, I looked at my summer practicum in DC as a way to escape my life and responsibilities back in Providence. Literally – I submitted my final assignment on a Thursday night, and I was on the plane to DC the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also looked at it as a way to rethink myself outside of the “student” identity I’ve been clinging to for…forever. I also realized that this was the first summer since high school where I wasn’t working multiple jobs AND/OR taking classes AND trying to be a person. So, when I wasn’t at the office, I let this summer about being a person first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time reading the books on my to-read shelf. (Highlights: &lt;em&gt;Parable of the Sower&lt;/em&gt; by Octavia Butler, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore&lt;/em&gt; by Robin Sloan, and &lt;em&gt;Everything I Never Told You&lt;/em&gt; by Celeste Ng.) I invested in my half-marathon training, making it up to eight miles as I ran up and down the Rock Creek Parkway. (Side note: if you can run in DC humidity, I feel as though you can run through anything. My mile time has dropped almost two minutes on returning to New England.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working on projects that I had put off for a long time. I drafted a Fulbright application (!!!), wrote blog posts, fleshed out project outlines, applied to conferences. Whether or not those are successful ventures, it doesn’t really matter – though it would be nice if they all did. But it let me write for myself – not for class, not taking notes, but actually getting ideas down on paper for the sheer sake of getting them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode the WMATA to pretty much everywhere. I visited a ton of museums and cultural institutions: small ones, big ones, art and history and science and culture. I spent time paying attention to my own reactions in these spaces, instead of the visitors like I normally do. What did I like about these spaces? What objects drew my attention? I read exhibit labels with reckless abandon, I joined docent tours or went on my own, and meandered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did a lot of networking. (Or, at the very least, I tried to network. Still not sure how that works.) I reached out and asked people about their jobs and their work. I met with people with job titles across the spectrum – curators, librarians, archivists, historians, directors, grant officers, researchers, media technologists, even other grad students. In addition to getting to know some amazing people, I also found myself trying on their job titles as labels. &lt;em&gt;Would I want to be here in a year? Can I see myself doing this type of work?&lt;/em&gt; I came out of almost all these conversations feeling really excited and energized to do exactly what they were doing – only to have the next conversation help me imagine a totally different life or opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what I came away with, towards the very end of the summer, is this: I am a public human. I know that’s not a job title, but it is a goal. I’m invested in creating, supporting, and sustaining a public. The questions and values of public humanities – as undefinable as we might want to make them out to be – recognize people &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; ideas deserve individual attention, but also connected attention. My practicum at SCLDA helped pursue that by understanding the ways in which digital collections can fit into all of our lives to pursue these types of opportunities. The rest of my summer helped me realize that public humanities fits into my own life – what organizations I interact with, my own communities, and how best to advocate for that in the world around me. And I guess that means I’m in the right place. (Good job, me of the past!) it’s set up for this second and final year of the program knowing more clearly what I want out of being at Brown for another year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s mid-semester now, and being back in the student routine has changed things a bit. But I’ve also built strategies for myself to make sure I get to be both a person &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a student. I don’t do school work at home. I make my workouts less something that I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do and more goal-oriented. I’m reading a bit more for fun (shout out to John Green’s new book!) I’m making sure to take time on the weekends to actually take a break, explore Providence, and not just sit in the library doing work all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my practicum as well as the time outside it to reevaluate where I am. I really needed that opportunity, and I truly loved both the professional and personal aspects of my summer. And whatever may come next, I’m glad that I have found a way to be a public human as an identity in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all of the people who helped me come to these realizations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to Steven Lubar, Ron Potvin, and my cohort for following me virtually through this practicum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to everyone at SCLDA, especially Pino Monaco and Stephanie Norby, for providing the wonderful opportunity to work with them this summer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to everyone who responded to my emails and met with me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to the International Student House of DC community &amp;amp; the people who I ate breakfast &amp;amp; dinner with every day&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>&#8220;Hindsight Is Always 20/20&#8221;</title>

   <updated>2017-07-02T21:29:19-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/hindsight-is-always-2020</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve visited this installation twice now, and I’m fascinated by its data-as-art example. (Is this a common trend in art that I just haven’t gotten around to yet?) It’s in the newly renovated &lt;em&gt;American Presidents&lt;/em&gt; wing at the National Portrait Gallery, which is a treat in itself to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; size-full wp-image-9900 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/unnamed.jpg?resize=700%2C525&quot; alt=&quot;unnamed&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/unnamed.jpg?w=3264&amp;amp;ssl=1 3264w, https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/unnamed.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/unnamed.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/unnamed.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/unnamed.jpg?w=1400&amp;amp;ssl=1 1400w, https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/unnamed.jpg?w=2100&amp;amp;ssl=1 2100w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hindsight Is Always 20/20” is a fairly standard word cloud gimmick, using eye charts as a way to visualize frequency of words. I’ve never really thought of distant reading as hindsight, but I suppose DuBois may be onto something here. Of course, I have many questions about how effective this actually is. For one, you can’t tell what the difference is between each line’s frequency. It’s also unclear if DuBois has filtered any words from this (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hindsightisalways2020.net&quot;&gt;He has, and he’s also made it so that words don’t repeat.&lt;/a&gt;) What does that do to this as a review of these charts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase is, of course, pretty great for this installation – but I think I love it more because of the use of eye charts. Because these are tests of &lt;em&gt;vision&lt;/em&gt; – in the same way that State of the Union addresses represent a test of vision for a President as they enter a new year of the administration. (DuBois goes into this in more detail &lt;a href=&quot;http://hindsightisalways2020.net&quot;&gt;on his site&lt;/a&gt;, but it just feels really clever that I had to point it out myself.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also interested in the fact that the description notes this installation as “the lexicon of each presidency.” I really want to see someone take these apart historically – go back to the SOTU addresses, connect them with their histories or historic events. I mean, just as distant reading normally functions, this can be used as a jumping-off point to understanding these presidencies. Combined with the portraits, we can perhaps reconstruct a president’s self-image and vision for the America he sought to shape.  And how do those relate to the way we view these presidencies now – either as a public or as historians?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking it further that DuBois points out, the lexicon of the presidency as a position. What issues can we glean from viewing these as a set in addition to individuals? Names of countries come up often, probably in reference to foreign diplomacy. Sometimes subjects are references explicitly – &lt;em&gt;banking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;economy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Indians&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;slavery&lt;/em&gt; – but many of these are related words, for which we must reconstruct. What words do we use to dance around other subjects, like &lt;em&gt;war&lt;/em&gt;? And &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hindsight always 20/20? What about the words that show up lower on the chart? What about the words that repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learninglab.si.edu/search?page=1&amp;amp;st=Luke+Dubois+&amp;amp;st_op=and&quot;&gt;Learning Lab&lt;/a&gt; for all the eye charts&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Learning to Extract &#038; Understand Twitter Data</title>

   <updated>2017-06-28T21:24:44-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hastac.org/blogs/sheishistoric/2017/06/27/twarc-learning-extract-understand-twitter-data&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;HASTAC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m currently working on a research to document and explore the Twitter resistance movement that’s formed in the wake of the Trump administration. In order to visualize, save, and explore the vast number of tweets that have appeared under various accounts and hashtags during this time, I decided to turn to Twarc.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Developed by Ed Summers for the Documenting the Now project, Twarc is a command line tool and Python library for archiving Twitter JSON data. Using the Twitter API, users can collect tweets, hashtags, trends, followers, friends, retweets, replies…basically, anything publicly available on Twitter can be requested here. Using various commands, you can even set up libraries of certain hashtags and accounts, to track trending information. Twarc is one of four primary tools developed by Documenting the Now to work with Twitter data, all with varying levels of technical proficiency. Twarc, like these other tools, reflect an effort to chronicle historically significant events and consider ethical ways of working with social media content. Pitched from a mindset geared towards “archivists of the future,” Twarc offers a way to think about collecting and archiving Twitter data in forms that prioritize context, safety, and usability. And though other tools of this type may exist for this type of work, Twarc seems best prepared to handle long-term curation and expansive requests of Twitter data. In addition, the DocNow team behind its use champions many of the questions around social media activism that may be placed in conversation with my aims for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>The Founding of Stars Hollow: Glassberg on Gilmore Girls (Part One)</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://starshollowhistoricalsociety.wordpress.com/2017/06/10/the-founding-of-stars-hollow-glassberg-on-gilmore-girls-part-one-by-emily-esten/&quot;&gt;Stars Hollow Historical Society&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone’s favorite close-knit community, Stars Hollow, Connecticut, thrives on small-town charm, tourism, and commemorating local history. The show presents two narratives of the town’s founding throughout the show’s seven-season run: 1) the star-crossed lovers meeting in the location of the town’s gazebo; and 2) the story of a Puritan family arriving in the seventeenth century. Regardless of their portrayals as true stories or imagined pasts, both narratives, which capitalize on myth and nostalgia to create a compelling story. From a public history perspective, the show’s depiction and commentary on Stars Hollow’s founding plays directly into concepts of nostalgia, memory, and commemoration in communities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The first of these founding myths, the star-crossed lovers, appears twice onscreen through one of the many celebratory festivals celebrated in Stars Hollow, Connecticut. Featured in episodes S1E16 “Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers” and S4E13 “Nag Hammadi Is Where They Found the Gnostic Gospels,” the Firelight Festival commemorates the town’s founding and namesake. Described by Miss Patty, the story states that star-crossed lovers snuck out of their homes and followed a band of stars to a spot in the countryside. “And there,” says Miss Patty, “waiting for her was her one true love who had also been led here by the blanket of friendly stars. And that, my friends is how Stars Hollow came to be and why we celebrate that fateful night every year about this time.” According to the story, the town commemorated the lovers’ meeting-place with the famous Stars Hollow Gazebo.&lt;/p&gt;

Me and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (Founder and First President of the Republic of Turkey) outside the Turkish Embassy. I think.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 48 hours, between &lt;a href=&quot;http://dupontkaloramamc.com/walk-weekend-2017/&quot;&gt;Dupont-Kalorama Walk Weekend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://firstfridaydupont.org/&quot;&gt;First Friday Dupont&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been to six museums, five art galleries, and one zoo. (Yes, I am very tired and kinda need a break from museums…until next weekend.) Some disconnected thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Growing up in a suburban area, I never really thought about museums as community spaces. Going to a museum was an adventure in itself – we would drive somewhere, usually far away (or what seemed far away to a kid). Museums weren’t places that felt embedded in my understanding of the world – they were destinations of culture rather than places to build a relationship. Obviously, I’m of a totally different mindset now, but the Walk Weekend made me think of how lucky urban neighborhoods are to be able to build local cultural experiences, and how important it is for consortiums like DKMC to engage with the neighborhoods in which they operate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve wanted to go the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5ndjutqXUAhUr2IMKHfviCqQQFggrMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dupontunderground.org%2F&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH2c1ThNYn-0xI4XwzIY-AGApxcTQ&amp;amp;sig2=NiCwO-sWcPu2DwdYm7qTxw&quot;&gt;Dupont Underground&lt;/a&gt; for awhile now after &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/malgorzatar&quot;&gt;MJ Rymsza-Palowska&lt;/a&gt; mentioned it in conversation once upon a time. And I’ve been walking it by it frequently since arriving in DC, so I was super excited to see it open for First Friday. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/870781072988155904&quot;&gt;The graffiti culture collection&lt;/a&gt; currently on display felt like a great fit for this location. The “No Sides in Science” theme they had going Friday night certainly attracted a lot of attention following the president’s announcement re: the Paris Climate Agreement. I’m looking forward to attend another event there, and maybe do the historic tour at some point? (Side note: does Providence have a space like this? Am I missing out in my city?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BU7Sf3ghs50ZqJRWc8WVDdj7TOoGhB6Fhcg9Co0/?taken-by=sheishistoric&quot;&gt;Art is super cool.&lt;/a&gt; (I apologize for not citing my sources here – I usually try to be really good about including labels alongside images.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phillipscollection.org&quot;&gt;Phillips Collection&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to being B-E-A-utiful, was filled with activity on Saturday morning. Good on that programming staff for getting performers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/871043516809572352&quot;&gt;discovery packs&lt;/a&gt;, scavenger hunts, and an instrument petting zoo together.&lt;/li&gt;

The migrant, whose life had been rural and nurtured by earth, was now moving to urban life dependent on industrial machines.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’ve never heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phillipscollection.org/collection/migration-series&quot;&gt;Jacob Lawrence’s &lt;em&gt;Migration Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before, but was captivated by the images and captions in the work. The Phillips Collection only has the odd-numbered paintings, but the story is still easy to follow: the mass movement of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North between World War I and World War II. This particular image stuck out to me, especially in wake of the president’s comment re: Pittsburgh and the Paris Agreement. I can’t find the exact Twitter thread that was discussing this point about the way in which industry of the Rust Belt is tied directly to conversations around environmental history as well as African American history. But it was super relevant to the way I was interpreting the work, and the caption for this piece felt particularly revealing of the story being told in &lt;em&gt;Migration Series.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dumbartonhouse.org&quot;&gt;Dumbarton House&lt;/a&gt; is also the headquarters of The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America. Their second floor Thinking of this in context with #berks2017 and #WomenAlsoKnowHistory, the exhibit reminded me of not only the idea of women historians being under-represented, but women’s role in preserving and maintaining history is often hidden from larger narratives. How can women’s history engage these ideas more frequently (Or maybe it already does? Please share! And share book suggestions related to this.)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dumbarton House also had an activity tied to their exhibit on the Articles of Confederation and the Federalist Papers &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/871395823883603968&quot;&gt;to get visitors writing to Congress&lt;/a&gt;! I know not every museum in the position to do this, but I appreciated that a) they gave an example of how IMLS funding directly affects the museum and b) provided scripts, addresses, postcards, AND postage for anyone who wanted to participate. I know there are other places doing these kinds of participatory civic action projects, but this was the first organization that I’ve visited doing so. There were a good number of postcards when I added mine this morning!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I was explaining to someone here how I feel going to museums. I noted that I feel less critical or in “public human” mode in an art museum. In history museums and historic houses especially, I feel myself being hypercritical with interpretation, layout, and watching other visitors interact in the space. It’s not that don’t enjoy myself in these spaces interpreting history – I do! – it’s just that I’m always inside my head and trying to be a museum-goer as well as public historian. (Guides notice this, too – I had a few ask me about my background as I accidentally started bombarding them with questions.) Art museums have less of that baggage for me – I’m able to separate myself from the the “critical” public humanities mindset quite easily. Instead, it’s a place where I’m having fun, interacting with the art and the space much more freely. tldr&lt;strong&gt;; invite me to your art museum/gallery visits for fun times, invite me to the historic places if you want to see me at work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As I’m spending more time in art galleries recently, I’m fascinated by the use of data for art. I spent the past semester exploring how to build visualizations that are fair to the data and visually appealing. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/865978093437112320&quot;&gt;Michael Joo’s &lt;em&gt;Migrated&lt;/em&gt; at the Sackler Galler&lt;/a&gt;y&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emilyesten.com/2017/05/29/visiting-the-hirshhorn/&quot;&gt;Reynier Levya Novo’s &lt;em&gt;5 Nights&lt;/em&gt; at the Hirshhorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and Kathryn Clark’s &lt;em&gt;Foreclosure Quilt&lt;/em&gt; at the Renwick Gallery are all pieces struggling with these same questions that I have. But they do so in a way that decenters the data as fact and emphasizes the aesthetic of data, which is cool and a fascinating line of thought. Art, especially contemporary art, constantly seeks to reflect on society and the issues surrounding us. Bringing data into that environment – in a different way than journalism infographics or typical data visualization projects, but in a similar vein as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dear-data.com/&quot;&gt;Dear Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – makes me think about the relationship between all of these ideas.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/871124244771606529&quot;&gt;Going to the National Zoo&lt;/a&gt; made me realize two things: 1) I have not been to a zoo in years! 2) I have not spent a lot of time around young children in years! Zoos don’t come up much in public human conversations, but they should. Zoos are public spaces in urban (semi-urban) areas where educational programming is taking place, and interpretation is key to getting the right of ideas across. Zoos struggle with questions of accessibility to the objects (or animals) and comfort the visitor. Their methods of interpretation draw on questions and active learning as well as passive experiences. Totally different spaces, I know – but I wonder what we could learn from each other. It was fascinating to hear conversations from parents to their kids. At one point, I watched the zookeeper feed carrots and apples to the elephants. The parent next to me turned their child and said, “Look! The elephant eats their fruit and vegetables! Be like an elephant!”&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Final thought: Still in awe of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/871459339881598976&quot;&gt;this at the Renwick Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Visiting the Hirshhorn</title>

   <updated>2017-05-28T21:55:38-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/dc-practicum-2017/visiting-the-hirshhorn</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally made it to the Hirshhorn after many, many visits to DC. Unfortunately, I was a bit too late to visit Yayoi Kusama’s “Infinity Mirrors”.  However, I did get to check out the rest of the Masterworks collection. I was particularly captivated by this piece:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_9844&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-9844&quot; style=&quot;width: 1080px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-9844&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/c3gvcg7xaae-ui8.jpg?resize=700%2C467&quot; alt=&quot;c3gvcg7xaae-ui8&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;467&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/c3gvcg7xaae-ui8.jpg?w=1080&amp;amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/c3gvcg7xaae-ui8.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/c3gvcg7xaae-ui8.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/c3gvcg7xaae-ui8.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;caption-attachment-9844&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;From his series “The Weight of History,” Reynier Leyva Novo&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;5 Nights&amp;#8221; (2014) is on view in [#HirshhornMasterworks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HirshhornMasterworks?src=hash): &amp;lt;https://t.co/1i0yNkgGx7&amp;gt; [pic.twitter.com/GopPFJdKk6](https://t.co/GopPFJdKk6)

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Weight of History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5 Nights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ink&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Joseph H. Hirshhorn Purchase Fund, 2016 (16.12)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In his series “The Weight of History,” Reyneir Leyva Novo employs iNk, a software developed to compute the weight, volume, and area of the ink used in printed documents. 5 Nights applies the iNk software to five revolutionary texts that constituted the basis of totalitarian regimes in the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a stark image, for one. The piece is in this transition space between two galleries – there’s not much else in the room. And from a distance, it doesn’t seem like much. To be honest, if I’d hadn’t turned my head the right way, I would’ve completely missed the piece altogether.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m fascinated by the use of data here for spatial purposes, and for artistic ones. On my first approach, I wondered what the scale was – atrocities were my first thought. To instead focus on the ink – not even the words, or the text itself, but the ink – makes for a more interesting line of questioning. What are we supposed to get from “The Weight of History” in “5 Nights” here? Are we thinking about print and print culture, and the ways in which revolutionary texts take up a physical space in or world? Are we thinking about how to compare each ink block’s representations – both the texts and the totalitarian regimes? Are we thinking about the metadata that matters from an object – and what is obscured or brought forth in this kind of installation that plays with data? Why is it the ink that matters – to Reynier Leyva Novo, to the piece, to me?&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe what’s weighing on me the most with this piece, though, is its placement in the museum. What exactly the piece is saying in context with its surroundings? I can’t image this placement is random. If you turn around, you’re facing a cityscape- federal Washington, with the most prominent building being the National Archives. Here, you have totalitarian regimes facing the founding documents upon which American mythology is based. You have this place filled with ink – ink of revolutionary texts, that constituted the basis of American history in some form or fashion. The two must be in conversation somehow; whether the artist intended that conversation I’m not sure. But the Hirshhorn must have considered it – and so I’d love to know how others have approached this questions and this piece in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Chapter 3: The Atlanta Compromise, Reacting to the Past</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/graduate/chapter-3-the-atlanta-compromise-reacting-to-the-past/"/>
   <updated>2017-05-08T16:00:47-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/graduate/chapter-3-the-atlanta-compromise-reacting-to-the-past</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hastac.org/blogs/sheishistoric/2017/05/08/chapter-3-atlanta-compromise-reacting-past&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;HASTAC&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a collaborative review of &lt;em&gt;Structuring Equality&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In its efforts to center student learning, Finkel’s chapter argues that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reacting.barnard.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;“Reacting to the Past” (RTTP)&lt;/a&gt; game framework encourages student participation and reflection while engaging with history. Pioneered at Barnard College, RTTP pedagogy gives students control of the classroom, taking on assigned roles in historical events Through their participatory model, RTTP games offer a mode for students to improve their persuasive oral and written communications skills. Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/event/Atlanta-Compromise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Atlanta Compromise&lt;/a&gt; as the premise for this particular assignment, Finkel brings a new entrance to exploring historical motivations regarding important moments in African American history. Finkel provides a sample instructor guide for the Atlanta Compromise Game, including a curricular schedule and suggested reading list to illuminate the pedagogy she employed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As Finkel notes, the topic of counterfactual gameplay is integral to the concept of structuring equity in the classroom through pedagogy. However, its application to intersectional histories or events seems equally important to educational innovation. The chapter leaves open the questions of retention and historical thinking: are students engaging with the historical content and embracing historical thinking of members of the Atlanta Compromise? And though Finkel discusses how RTTP games strengthen historical empathy for events of the past, the chapter lacks detail on why this model is particularly relevant for tackling African American history.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Still, Finkel’s argument for pedagogical gameplay is value to tackling the flipped classroom, and even more so for breaking the single-narratives of history. Restructuring education for gameplay can drive students to not only improve individually as valued participants in the classroom, but ask them to think of historical events as conscious decisions. While the gamemaster position of the teacher still implies some level of authority, students have the power to change the narrative and direct coursework by identifying motivations, objectives, and strategies of the past. RTTP prioritizes reflection and comprehension throughout the process, making experiential learning a path to structural equity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To paraphrase that introduction from the old days of Internet: Hi, I’m Emily, and I’m from Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is a bit of a cop-out, but I thought I’d share my work in PH not through a to-do list but through a place that represents a passive but important aspect of my engagement in PH. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;vertical=default&amp;amp;q=%23dayofph&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;#DayofPH&lt;/a&gt; is being advertised on Twitter, and it’s quite fitting why: it’s a place where I’ve curated a professional identity in PH, share my work, and meet other public humans finding ways to bring the insights and ideas to an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Catalog as Book, File, and Database: Cataloging History, Part 3</title>

   <updated>2017-05-02T13:00:33-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Co-written with Steven Lubar on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lubar/catalog-as-book-file-and-database-ac954096152e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the third part of a four-part series on the history and theory of museum and exhibition catalogs, focusing on the 1853 New York Crystal Palace. We use the catalogs of the Crystal Palace to consider catalogs (and their descendent, the database) more generally. (This installment is co-authored with &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hastac.org/u/sheishistoric&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Emily Esten&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id=&quot;32ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
  This third part considers the catalog as physical and digital object. The catalog began as a physical thing. It was crafted from the forms submitted by exhibitors and compiled into lists. It was set in type, printed, bound, boxed, and distributed. In the twenty-first century, the physical object was scanned. It became a digital object, a file. It could be used in new ways, put to new purposes. It began a second chapter in its history. Looking closely at process allows us to understand what its creators intended. Looking closely at product allows us to consider the affordances of each of these forms, what it encouraged and allowed.
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Calling Something a Dataset: Visualizing the Crystal Palace</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since December, I’ve been working with Steven Lubar for a presentation at Bard College last week. The event focused on the 1853 New York Crystal Palace. Lubar has introduced his presentation over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lubar/cataloging-history-eac876941db6&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. (Parts one through three are up at the moment – the next installment will complement this piece.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Most of my time with this project has been cleaning, wrangling, and interrogating the dataset. (Side note: does anyone remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/46712&quot;&gt;that poem&lt;/a&gt; about literary analysis being like torture? It sometimes feels that way with datasets too.) As we’ve discussed in class, cleaning data is a never-ending process – the data we started with wasn’t &lt;em&gt;raw&lt;/em&gt;, but carefully curated OCR from a Cornell Library database. In wrangling the data into a CSV and under headings specific to our needs, we shifted the catalog as a book into a catalog as a database, bringing up multiple questions of historical and technical interest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Working through the data as a whole and as individual objects, Lubar and I worked to figure out what kind of questions could be explored in the catalog. What was this exhibition? What was interesting about it? What kind of information was collected for the catalog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ncph.org/conference/2017-annual-meeting/&quot;&gt;NCPH 2017&lt;/a&gt;‘s theme “Meeting in the Middle” had both physical and thematic resonance to this year’s conference. Meeting in Indianapolis at the “crossroads of America,” NCPH pitched this year’s theme in terms of self-reflection. Where is public history going?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Finally attending NCPH in person was like a hug. During a time when the work of public historians seems crucial to sharing communities, I felt inspired by the passionate people and projects in attendance. As someone who casually lives on Twitter, live-tweeting at NCPH made for some great backchanneling during the conference. I’ve documented some of the most important Twitter takes below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The questions behind this week’s readings reminded me of two episodes of &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;/em&gt; where the national consciousness of arts and culture come into play. In S3E7, “Gone Quiet,” WH Communications Director Toby Ziegler meets with a representative from the appropriations committee who wants to cut the NEA out of the budget. Weaving in and out of their conversation through the episode, there are some great rants interspersed throughout about the need to support the arts. The representative’s real problem lies the Director of the NEA, who’s funding “outrageous” projects by funding the museums rather than individual artists.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This week’s readings reminded me of our review of Nina Simon’s job application, and the choice to relegate “sustainability” of community engagement efforts as least important. At the time, I chose to do so out of clarity – shouldn’t sustainability be addressed in the bridging and engaging activities, and so this would be an afterthought?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.brown.edu/amst-2650-s01-spring-2017/&quot;&gt;AMST 2650&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.brown.edu/amst-2650-s01-spring-2017/2017/03/28/more-anarchy-in-the-usa/&quot;&gt;Like Rica&lt;/a&gt;, I am both excited and skeptical of Vangone’s approach to the historic house museum. Vagnone, like Simon, shows investment in community, creativity and culture for the field. But, as Rica discusses, none of this seems particularly anarchist/revolutionary? Sure, Vagnone may be the first to compile it into a text, but much of this language has been part of what I consider public humanities literature and discussion of at least the last 5-10 years. I feel bombarded with “museum visionaries” like Simon and Vagnone to the point that this is my norm and my expectation for museums. The person that needs to be convinced is no longer me – in fact, it probably never was me, because this is the standard for thought leadership in the field at the moment.  I’m interacting with the “right” people – the people interested in change and ~revitalization~ – and so I’d be more curious to hear from classmates who’ve been on the inside about just how difficult these kind of changes are once inside the museum. Is Vagnone directing his work at the wrong person? Or am I just too optimistic about how change works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Digital Storytelling: It’s Britney, Bitch: Commentary on Distortion in Spears’s Use of Social Media</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalstorytelling.jimmcgrath.us&quot;&gt;Digital Storytelling&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who at times seems to only exist on Twitter, I’m fascinated by the ways in which people use the platform to craft their own narratives. But I also love the off-the-beaten-path accounts – bots, parodies, and what I like to call commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time looking at this third type, namely through examples of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WillMcAvoyACN&quot;&gt;@WillMcAvoyACN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity&quot;&gt;@SwiftOnSecurity&lt;/a&gt;. I stand by my point that these are _not _parody accounts. In the latter, as much as they’re prenteding to be Taylor Swift, they’re not going through the daily motions or documenting on her activities. Instead, it’s almost like she was dropped in an alternative dimension – same music, same image, but just talking about tech security instead of herself. Taylor’s persona, which was much more present at the beginning of the account than it is now, served as a gimmick to interest people in the content. McAvoy is a bit different – it’s a fictional persona – but it still prioritizes content over defined character. In his interactions with fans as well as real-life reporters, McAvoy serves as a commentary of journalism by playing through the persona as well as commenting on its usage to hold people accountable for the things they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as I wrote on Slack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inspired by the Twitter account SwiftOnSecurity, I’m looking to build a Twitter profile that engages/raises awareness around a keyword, but doing so through a persona that challenges or distorts the messages being presented. How does this observational view of a topic – one that a persona may have a reasonable stake in – change the ways in which we understand the topic? And in what ways do the tools available on Twitter – GIFs, photos, hashtags, polls, locations – distort or shape the ways in which we understand the project? Thinking around questions from Chun and Parise, why do we invest in this information even when the likelihood of the person behind it false? In what ways does this allow us to imagine the persona and the issues complexly? Can we explore these complexities in a project like this? In what ways do we see a persona like SwiftOnSecurity highlighting or hiding the relationship? Ideally, I’ll be looking at both my construction and reception by an audience (depending on what kind of audience is generated) to talk about how distortion functions in this environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>AMST 2650: Non-Object Based Cultural Appropriation (?)</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conn in particular, though it’s certainly a running theme in all of these readings, identifies that objects are no longer central to the conception and function of the museum (58). (I mean, the entire book is called ‘Do Museums Still Need Objects?’, so that’s not insightful.) Still, though, Conn’s discussion around of objects in the issues of repatriation highlights issues specific to cultural work around displaying and interpreting these objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I wanted to try something new this week – live tweeting myself working through the assigned readings. I had a plan to Storify these tweets, but&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a) 50 tweets is a lot for a Twitter thread and&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;b) even for Storify, it would be a lot of work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s the draft of what I had written, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m fascinated this week by the combination between commemoration as a physical presence (in the construction of memorials, as Doss discusses) and an experiential one (in Sandage’s article on protests during the Civil Rights Movement.) It’s one thing to focus on the ways in the constructed presence or its intended narrative, as Gopnik does in his criticisms of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. However,  it’s quite another issue to think of the constructed presence as something on which we present our feelings, interpretations, and constructed legacies. While the readings this week have focused primarily on the physical constructions of representations of the past (aside from Sandage), I’m curious more directly how politics of memory influence the celebrations/protests/events that occur around the physical memorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>AMST 2650: Ramblings Re: HAMILTON, Founding Fathers Fandom, and Myth as a Framework(?)</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a self-professed fan of &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; and Lin-Manuel Miranda as well as conscious public historian, I feel obliged to love &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; in all its problematic essence. Reviewing it as a case study through this lens of myth, nostalgia, and memory, I’m less curious as a work of “escapist fiction” Allen presents than as a “liberal incremental piece of art” Noonan writes about.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m reminded this week of &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEIvAIyyZSZU&amp;amp;t=YTlhMzBiNWJiOWYzMjYwM2JkNGQzMmZjNDQ4NDAxNjc4ZjI5YjgyYixQT0JEWFNLOQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3ABuHYNeU4S-GsP_cqG_AnuA&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fthefederalistfreestyle.tumblr.com%2Fpost%252&quot;&gt;the talk by Rebecca Onion&lt;/a&gt; (1:04:55) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/03/inside-tumblrs-founding-fathers-fandom.html#comments&quot;&gt;a subsequent article&lt;/a&gt;, in which she discussed on decontextutalized history on the internet. Onion, who spends a lot of time on the Internet focused on crap history and virality, used the article to discuss the emotional connections to history –  particularly the sexual, LGB nature of the founding father fandom on Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>AMST 2650: Making Museums Public vs. Making Museum Publics</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In talking about public humanities, our first question is always &lt;em&gt;how do we make humanities public&lt;/em&gt;? And the question, as identified in these readings, is always a structural one. Especially in the Bandelli and Williams article, the shifts occurring in the museological sphere emphasize changing the hierarchical structures and levels of authority in museum staffing. The article identifies giving a public a voice within the decision-making process, while still upholding reliability and trustworthiness – as key to making museums democratic spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I found myself drawn to Barrett’s earlier chapters, discussing the history of “the public,” and the role of the state within museums/institutions to craft these narratives of education, leisure, and discipline.  It reminded me of tours I conducted in downtown Providence with the Rhode Island Historical  Society (RIHS). With this collaborative urban education program, the students and I explored the resources of the city.  RIHS made the decision to showcase these resources through publics spaces that emphasized art, history, and culture. Discussing the city as a system of parts, we used places like the Convention Center, Kennedy Plaza, RISD Library, and Burnside Park to celebrate the value of public spaces within the function of a city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>HASTAC: Talking through NCPH 2017</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From HASTAC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a participant in the NCPH 2017 Working Group “Meeting in the Middle: Community Engagement in a Digital World,” ten public history practitioners and I are talking through the successes and struggles of web 2.0 projects. Seeing digital projects as places of shared authority, silence and exclusion, as well as part of the broader definition of digital citizenship, we’re looking to build thought leadership around historian participation in digital environments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;NCPH’s working groups bring together public history practitioners in the months leading up to the conference to discuss a problem in the field, define questions for that issue, and come up with an end product documented for other NCPH members. In this working group, facilitated by Kristen Baldwin Deathridge (Appalachian State University), Jane M. Davis (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and Lara Kelland (University of Louisville), we’re hoping to develop a “best practices” manual. Working through our own case statements, we hope to critique the challenges, limitations, and divides present in the digital sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This past semester, my course tackled the traditional DH assignment – “(Not) Reading a Nineteenth-Century Novel.” In a class focused on how DH fits within graduate study of English departments, the premise of the assignment made a lot of sense. These are literary scholars looking to understand how these tools fit within their research goals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But as a public human(ist), my interests in the course were slightly different. Public humanities is for me a pedagogy – a collection of tools, methods, and theory to address reframing scholarship for community engagement and public works. So my biggest question coming out of this assignment was quite simple: what do these tools do to public understanding of a work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>three little words (2017)</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/three-little-words-2017/"/>
   <updated>2017-01-01T07:13:16-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/three-little-words-2017</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Taking an idea from Heather VanMouwerik at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/gradhacker/making-positive-changes-new-year&quot;&gt;GradHacker&lt;/a&gt; (who, in turn, took the idea from &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisbrogan.com/3-words-2016/&quot;&gt;Chris Brogan&lt;/a&gt;), I’m replacing a New Year’s Resolutions with three little words for 2017. As Brogan describes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pick any three words that will guide in the choices you intend to make for [2017]. They should be words that let you challenge yourself as to motives and decisions. They should be words that help you guide your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, &lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyesten.com/2015/01/04/2015-a-year-in-resolutions/&quot;&gt;my resolutions&lt;/a&gt; tend to come out as words anyway – it’s easier to think and connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOCUS:&lt;/strong&gt; I see focus functioning on two levels. For one, I need to think more seriously about getting through professional papers and workloads. I’ve been able to implement discipline into other aspects of my life, and now I need to bring it to my professional realm. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/3h76yq/text_dont_rely_on_motivation_for_anything_it_is/&quot;&gt;Motivation is fickle, discipline is unyielding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note: Like any interdisciplinary maven, I feel as though I’m torn between so many different ideas and concepts. And while I love that I can reach into multiple directions, Ia also don’t want to spread myself thin. Borrowing from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-3cSwpYTRAhWE64MKHcwKAHkQFggbMAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chronicle.com%2Fblogs%2Fprofhacker%2Fthe-point-of-grad-school-is-to-learn-to-say-no%2F49385&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFB48nrRzEhDvB0pvhBS8CRYtAo3Q&amp;amp;sig2=-Ocmfi2oPiz3EAYvoMNIUg&amp;amp;bvm=bv.142059868,d.amc&quot;&gt;Brian Croxall’s “Learning to Say No,”&lt;/a&gt; I want to spend 2017 continuing to develop a clear vision of what one wants to achieve and how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNPACK: &lt;/strong&gt;Again, two levels. As a commuter student, my life is always in motion – from home to car to school to library to car to family to work to…and so on. To that end, I never really spend the time to unpack the contents of my life at the end of the day. Instead, I have at least three bags on my doorstep, a _really _messy car, a desk covered in ephemera, and a bedroom stuffed with Christmas supplies. So I really need to clean and unpack these physical spaces to get a sense&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also taking this as a way to unpack here – as in, Providence. Two years doesn’t seem long enough for me to settle down, explore, integrate into a community. Regardless, I think 2017 for me is about learning to unpack – to create entanglements in spaces and with people even when my time is short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metaphorically, I see unpacking tied to that last idea of focus. I’ve graduated from UMass and finished my first semester of grad school. Analyzing my life, my experiences, and myself, I’d like to spend some of 2017 in introspective. I’m known to ruminate – I want to unpack the rumination cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPEAK: &lt;/strong&gt;In general, I’m a quiet person. It’s not that I’m shy (though I certainly can be) –  I just don’t vocalize most of my responses. And I know it’s hindering me, my progress, and the people around me. In order to support &amp;amp; embrace the people/places/values for which I stand, I need to relearn how to speak for myself and for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And mostly, I see that starting again with my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unofficially going on hiatus was never a conscious decision of mine. If you took a look at my planner, you’ll still see “Blog Post” written on the Sunday of every week – sometimes with suggestions for a topic, most times just the generic reminder to think of one. But I see my not-blogging as the result of a few changes in my life as an undergrad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I stopped blogging due to time. I used to blog weekly, sitting down at my computer on Sunday afternoons to dust off a piece about daily experiences or some event that I had been to that past week. I used to livetweet lectures and workshops (something I still like to do, but I’m careful to respect the speaker’s work/privacy.) But now I feel like I spend all of my time &lt;em&gt;reading.&lt;/em&gt; I spend literally hours on Twitter (probably not the best use of my time), spend most of my afternoons keeping up with class readings, and now devote Sunday afternoons to clearing out my reading list. But that’s not a fair assessment, nor is it really a satisfying “thing” to blame my silence on. After all, I blogged for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honors.umass.edu/category/blog-column/taxonomy/term/717&quot;&gt;Commonwealth Honors College&lt;/a&gt; – but that didn’t take the place of what I was writing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I stopped writing in a public sphere because I felt unable to converse with &lt;em&gt;academia,&lt;/em&gt; or with &lt;em&gt;publics,&lt;/em&gt; or with &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;. I felt increasingly self-conscious of my blog posts as I went through undergrad. I mean, I watch great bloggers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pastexplore.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Nick Sacco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://historiann.com&quot;&gt;Ann M. Little&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://andrewpegoda.com&quot;&gt;Andrew Pegoda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thetattooedprof.com&quot;&gt;Kevin Gannon&lt;/a&gt; talk quite freely about their lives and their work. And maybe it’s just impostor syndrome kicking in, but I think I transitioned into a passive user of the Internet. In trying to curate my identity in a digital public, I started to take myself out those spaces. I didn’t feel qualified or empowered to speak on behalf of the field, or even myself. I found myself making expectations for my work that either became “too personal” or “too professional,” and so I settled on not writing anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cringe looking back at some of those earlier posts – not because they were bad, necessarily, but because I know it could be so much better if I wrote it now. They read like time capsules – moments of me being really excited about college and history and research! It was never really about the scholarship, but about my day-to-day activities – navigating school, navigating networking, navigating assignments, what have you. And it’s these glimpses into youthful joy and naivety that remind me to be excited about learning. They remind me that exploration and experimentation and thinking out loud is encouraged, and okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working on getting back into the groove of things. There are five unfinished blog posts on my desktop right now, on various subjects and for various places on the Internet. I’m devoting the time to finishing them. And I hope to continue documenting my experiences in this way – to not let writing be a chore, but to let it transition into something for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, first and foremost, rather than some grand internet public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in short: back to regular posting! Back to exploring my place in the world! Back to sharing joy and excitement and frustration in the fabulous field of public humanities. And back to finding myself in a digital public, whatever confusion that may bring.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ubuntu: Towards a Socially Responsible Study Abroad Program</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/graduate/edsurge/ubuntu-towards-a-socially-responsible-study-abroad-program/"/>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;11fb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;
  On my two-week summer intensive trip to South Africa, my professor reiterated the course mission statement: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ubuntu. &lt;/em&gt;A philosophy used in southern Africa, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ubuntu&lt;/em&gt; emphasizes a universal bond among humanity:“I am what I am because of who we all are.” Recognizing the humanness and kindness among individuals, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ubuntu &lt;/em&gt;speaks to a level of interconnectedness. It asks us to enrich ourselves by enabling the community around us, the crucial blocks for building global engagement.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id=&quot;84fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
  While we visited the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown and in our travels around Johannesburg, I made a conscious effort to incorporate &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ubuntu &lt;/em&gt;into my framework of thinking. Throwing myself into a completely different culture, even for a short amount of time, I found the concept of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ubuntu &lt;/em&gt;to be both demonstrative and healing.
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Maintaining Youthfulness in Academia</title>

  &lt;p id=&quot;8f0d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;
  I often think of my friend’s statement that university is a “teenage commune.” Her idea was that college is something of a strange place, where you take hundreds or thousands of students and have them live and work together 24/7. By doing so, you place them in this mentality where anything can happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id=&quot;54c4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
  I think this idea has merit — being an undergrad is a time in your life where embracing naivety and freedom is key. Within this loosely structured environment, spontaneity and playfulness led my friends and me into new adventures and experiences. But the teenage commune analogy works better in discussing social and extracurricular activities. My academic experience wasn’t quite like that. Being an undergraduate meant developing technical, critical, career-oriented skills, and transitioning into professional realms of maturity. But I’ve found myself wondering if it’s really possible to keep “youth” — or rather, youthfulness — at the heart of undergraduate experiences in academia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>My Year with Lin-Manuel Miranda</title>

&lt;p&gt;One of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://emilyesten.com/words/my-work/2015-a-year-in-resolutions/&quot;&gt;goals for 2015&lt;/a&gt; was to see &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;. I was six days too late,  but it was definitely a highlight of my year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me, &lt;em&gt;Hamilton _has taken up more that that one day in January. Over the course of my senior year, it’s been the soundtrack of my life. So intimately intertwined in my growth and development of the past year, _Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; has been there through it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playbill.com/article/the-verdict-read-critics-reviews-for-hamilton-on-broadway-com-356498&quot;&gt;_Hamilton _debuts on Broadway&lt;/a&gt;. I (not so) subtly mention to my mom how cool the show seems to be. I read everyone reviews, and wonder how amazing the soundtrack must be. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/634537834360250368&quot;&gt;I finish my summer internship with a George Washington event&lt;/a&gt;. I start packing for senior year. I start looking at my course list. I start thinking about this being my last year, and how much work I have left to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September:&lt;/strong&gt; I move back to UMass for my final year. I start classes. I count the days until the _Hamilton _album is released, only to have it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2015/09/21/440925873/first-listen-cast-recording-hamilton&quot;&gt;drop on NPR&lt;/a&gt; while I’m in class. I listen 3x a day until my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playbill.com/article/the-verdict-billboard-calls-hamilton-best-rap-album-of-2015-read-more-cast-album-reviews-here-com-365565&quot;&gt;preorder downloads&lt;/a&gt;. My immediate favorite is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg4qG45t_MAhVo6IMKHWmODA8QFggcMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F4cxvludVmQxryrnx1m9FqL&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGZY8KcdnExzsaz9oN2yWniQlqi-w&amp;amp;sig2=MifAN3qaECv-AiGX5PF3iA&amp;amp;bvm=bv.122129774,d.amc&quot;&gt;“My Shot.” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October:&lt;/strong&gt; I tell Mom I’m buying tickets. Mom tells me it’s a Christmas present. I finish binge-watching _The West Wing _and love &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplechrain.tumblr.com/post/124085376171/remember-that-time-lin-manuel-miranda-fancasted-a&quot;&gt;Lin’s fancast for a musical&lt;/a&gt;. I start applying to grad school. My brother and I perfect our routine to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9oZzK5t_MAhVM04MKHawmD6kQFggcMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F2G9lekfCh83S0lt2yfffBz&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHH0hisO8lOJM1S3YNZc0BBRX2O7w&amp;amp;sig2=F_VmrDmAUVsWi-wA_Ykozg&amp;amp;bvm=bv.122129774,d.amc&quot;&gt;“Farmer Refuted”&lt;/a&gt; on the ride home from school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November:&lt;/strong&gt; Friends start listening to &lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;– they also fall in love with it. I finish my literature review for my thesis! I’m rolling in _Hamilton _think pieces, and read them on my bus rides to Mount Holyoke. My favorite song now is definitely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-hqSO8t_MAhULuBoKHVSRASAQFggcMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F3dP0pLbg9OfVwssDjp9aT0&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF1PBG1D54NyKMsy5MrMjacIuFpbA&amp;amp;sig2=qeLG3cCDVGFooYw6iWfFNw&amp;amp;bvm=bv.122129774,d.dmo&quot;&gt;“Satisfied,”&lt;/a&gt; though I can’t sing as fast as Renee. And don’t even get me started on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGx--B8t_MAhUBGx4KHZB_CNUQFggdMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F7m9XR7FquXLP1FewdAcNS9&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFgt5s6H0HewYVcUPvbW1n0TMseHA&amp;amp;sig2=scAjeJ9JFrfYBbK6mWqZCw&quot;&gt;“Guns and Ships”&lt;/a&gt; – I WISH I could rap like Daveed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December:&lt;/strong&gt; My sister and I have a great duet for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGupfe5t_MAhVl1oMKHWMaDPIQFggfMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F6dr7ekfhlbquvsVY8D7gyk&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGYlVVEYi0WMeIE8OFbkHKgRblpbg&amp;amp;sig2=W5-6vyKdzXIxwDpQvKpwVw&amp;amp;bvm=bv.122129774,d.amc&quot;&gt;“Aaron Burr, Sir.”&lt;/a&gt; We switch off, but I’m usually Hamilton. Along with our brother, we rock “The Schuyler Sisters” – I’m Angelica, she’s Eliza, he’s Peggy. I finally read Chernow’s _Hamilton _on a long flight to Indianapolis. It complements the show beautifully (or vice versa, rather.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/684796643644968960&quot;&gt;I SEE &lt;em&gt;HAMILTON!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I am amazed that this show I have been obsessing over can exceed my expectations. I meet Andrew Chappelle and Chris Jackson and Betsy Strux. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2pTl9BgO4o&quot;&gt;I participate in the Ham4Ham&lt;/a&gt;.  I start listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj91rL55d_MAhUq_4MKHfufDl0QFggdMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fartist%2F6BrRyZRuy3RTzJjAXTc7Ts&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFqbsSq-0R71Zu9QwkzMJ0itfJMtg&amp;amp;sig2=LBPfQg6P7fsKw-uVzDj2hA&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Heights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and start thinking how Lin wrote it as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8jZGA6d_MAhVC9YMKHTLwBxQQFggtMAI&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2Farticle%2Fhow-lin-manuel-mirandas-in-the-heights-written-in-college-returned-to-his-alma-mater-com-335304&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGhpGeS4Dim1sO544eTdv9N9Mpj1w&amp;amp;sig2=k05QKQqiDxoEAJ_fGGZw1w&amp;amp;bvm=bv.122129774,d.amc&quot;&gt;a sophomore at Wesleyan&lt;/a&gt;. I start the first draft of my thesis, and start &lt;a href=&quot;http://8tracks.com/hunter-e-burke/write-like-you-re-running-out-of-time&quot;&gt;writing like I’m running out of time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February:&lt;/strong&gt; I am accepted to my first grad school on the same day &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/15/11010890/hamilton-lin-manuel-miranda-grammys-2016&quot;&gt;_Hamilton _performs at the Grammys&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playbill.com/article/hamilton-wins-grammy-for-best-musical-theater-album-com-386468&quot;&gt;and wins for Best Musical Theater Album!!!!&lt;/a&gt;) All my blog posts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honors.umass.edu/blog/eesten/moral-voyage-take-break&quot;&gt;subtly mention _Hamilton _lyrics&lt;/a&gt;. I have a morning routine that starts with “Alexander Hamilton” and ends with “Satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJkvm75d_MAhWk1IMKHYUKBSgQyCkIHzAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZPrAKuOBWzw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFaO-4oArKkDy6QU6KyAAuet0hpRQ&amp;amp;sig2=A6BcthL5-6axMYaHRNHxNA&quot;&gt;The cast performs at the White House&lt;/a&gt;. I visit DC at the end of the month to check out a grad school. I pick up &lt;a href=&quot;http://linmnuelmrnda.tumblr.com/post/140300911523/lin-manuel-miranda-for-arrive-magazine-2016&quot;&gt;a copy of _Arrive _with Lin on the cover&lt;/a&gt; on the train ride down. I come home for spring break. I hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=5&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1toHH6N_MAhUozIMKHV4GBxAQtwIINjAE&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEIvAIyyZSZU&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH53Rz9Eh2pyB97ww9Vv6k-iiwYZQ&amp;amp;sig2=RhCiQ4VQixYdUMiwUvw_Eg&quot;&gt;Rebecca Onion speak on history and the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, and cringe at her article re: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX64W86N_MAhVm3IMKHUgkBj4QFggdMAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnymag.com%2Fselectall%2F2016%2F03%2Finside-tumblrs-founding-fathers-fandom.html&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFJIrIsjbA05Q-JTS6qJU0X-myq5g&amp;amp;sig2=X6d_0v7IBK12mR7cog98vA&quot;&gt;Tumblr’s founding fathers fandom&lt;/a&gt;. The _Hamiltome _is published, but I don’t have time to read through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April:&lt;/strong&gt; I pick a grad school. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/724649699119128580&quot;&gt;I defend my thesis&lt;/a&gt;. I finish my finals a little early, and start to say goodbye to UMass. &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; is nominated for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwicwfjS6N_MAhWn3YMKHdxCBKMQFggdMAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F05%2F04%2Ftheater%2Fhamilton-tony-nominations-record.html&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNE-yIaiTzoUW1q73lmUOpe1yBTD_Q&amp;amp;sig2=NjBFzBHtNDAzUXpoFuqUag&quot;&gt;unprecedented sixteen Tonys&lt;/a&gt;, and we learn that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6roft6t_MAhWp64MKHSANCZoQFggkMAE&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2Farticle%2Ftreasury-secretary-to-announce-that-hamilton-will-stay-on-10-bill-com-351602&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGB4kT0qYxRp0hLg-N5iGrMa-Qp6g&amp;amp;sig2=mqywinvPb9T9Ai1NweScbg&quot;&gt;Alexander Hamilton will be staying on the $10&lt;/a&gt;, for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May:&lt;/strong&gt; I graduate on one of the rainiest days ever, and get soaked at commencement. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/728201636900933634&quot;&gt;My first cap&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t survive the rain, but my friend salvages the pieces and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFF6FFhLWxCzfJXg7Bt3UB9q6_lvd4ajH2IPx00/&quot;&gt;makes a new one&lt;/a&gt;. (I help.) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/16/lin-manuel-miranda-commencement-speech-hamilton&quot;&gt;Lin gives a commencement speech at UPenn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s to the cast of &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;: the soundtrack of my senior year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wanted to write this column as a guidebook in reverse – all the things I wish I had known going into a thesis. I expect I’ll be doing something like this again, and I wanted a way to remind myself of the trials and tribulations of a project of this magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m proud of myself for being able to do this honors thesis/project, and I’m grateful for the people who helped me along the way. I feel like it took a village to bring this thesis together – librarians, archivists, professors, friends, and family all guided me in some shape or form. Here’s what I’ve learned in looking back:&lt;/p&gt;

And while I still have a few weeks to go, I’m almost sad to finish it. I mean, I’m excited to move onto other projects, but this one has meant a lot to me. I’m told the official handing-in process (AKA putting your manuscript in a box) isn’t a satisfying conclusion. It sort of just…ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I know it’s a little early for me to be waxing poetic about the CHC experience – graduation is still VERY far away – but it was for an assignment. Each &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bdic.umass.edu/&quot;&gt;BDIC&lt;/a&gt; student has to write a “Senior Summary” as their final graduation requirement. It’s half assessment – what did you actually do for your curriculum, what did you learn, what skills did you acquire, etc. – but it’s also half reflection on your BDIC career. It allows me to review what I’ve accomplished, and think about how to present it to future employers or graduate schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It’s daunting to sit in a room with a really smart person in your field and have them give you constructive criticism. It’s intimidating and scary, and that’s amplified when you look at all the changes you have to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While I finish the last few pages of my first draft, I wanted to share something else about my academic experience: I am all about that Five College life. I’ve taken one course at Hampshire, Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and two at Smith. I didn’t set out for this accomplishment – it worked in my favor that there were classes that I was actually interested in and was able to fit in my schedule. I also lucked out in that BDIC encourages students to take courses at the other schools as part of your curriculum, but I know that a lot of departments will accept Five College courses towards your major requirements. I think everyone should at least try to take advantage of the amazing opportunity that is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fivecolleges.edu/consortium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Five College Consortium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m 75% finished with my rough draft – at least, I think I am? It’s hard to tell when you’re in the thick of it. It feels like I’m so close to reaching this goal and I want to power through. And yes, that’s a really good feeling to have at this stage – but it’s also stressful to be spending 4+ hours a day writing in addition to my class and work schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mark Schlemmer came to UMass last night for a public lecture on the #ITweetMuseums initiative. Schlemmer was great and the entire audience was excited and receptive to hear more about his projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tweeted a little and I took a lot of notes (this one is my favorite):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_9337&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-9337&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/emilyesten.com/words/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2784.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-9337&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-9337 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/emilyesten.com/words/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_2784-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_2784&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;caption-attachment-9337&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Twitter bird with #ITM button. Speech bubble: &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a twitter-based initiative!!!&amp;#8221;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter as a place of culture sharing/open culture&lt;/em&gt;: I find it fascinating that Schlemmer has stuck to keeping it a Twitter-based initiative – not because I think there is a better platform for what he’s done (there isn’t) – but because I think it’s showing the possibilities Twitter has to offer as a form of community-building. Twitter is best known for its stream-of-consciousness feature &amp;amp; its ability to give voice to the individual – and here, we have a direct example of it &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being that. (I mean, we could parse words and say it’s voicing an individual community, but it’s not even doing that.) It’s a reflection of a multitude of voices, experiences, and perspectives trying to give an inside look into a culture. And it’s designed for and by the people inside that culture, but is presented in a way that allows anyone to open and access that culture. And that’s really exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tweet-Ups are the coolest thing ever:&lt;/em&gt; I love this. I love this. I love this. Schlemmer identifies different purposes for tweet-ups – professional development, job skills, peer networking, increased visibility, culture sharing – all great points. And I love that attendees are tasked with using the museum/exhibition space and playing with Twitter as a source for narrative. They were funny, insightful, educational to look at – I can’t imagine what it’s really like to attend one! (Note: I bet UMass History is working on putting one together at this very moment.) The tweets Schlemmer shared reminded me a little bit of Teju Cole’s collections, in that both play with the purpose and possibilities in which we use Twitter for our own devices. There’s clickbait. There’s object identification. There’s linking artistic pieces together. There’s basic commentary. It’s awesome, and I need to check more out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Media is a Skill Set&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Social media is a skill set and it needs to be valued that way.&lt;/strong&gt; Let me say it again – &lt;strong&gt;social media is a skill set and it needs to be valued that way.&lt;/strong&gt; There are significant generational/institutional differences in the ways in which people use social media (especially noticeable with Facebook, but starting to come into play on Twitter) and it’s something users have to be aware of in order to experience these platforms. It’s something that can be acquired, but not every user of social media has this skill set.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I feel like this thesis makes me &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.spotify.com/track/7qfoq1JFKBUEIvhqOHzuqX?play=true&amp;amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=open&quot;&gt;write like I’m running out of time!&lt;/a&gt; But I’ve noticed one thing – I &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; write my thesis at the desk in my room. It’s impossible! I get distracted by the TV in my common room, the food in my kitchen, or the messiness of my side of the bedroom – everything in the world except my actual thesis. So, earlier this week, I set off in search of the perfect study spot on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Did anyone else feel like winter break was too short? I barely had time to unpack my bags before my inbox was flooded with “Spring Check-In” and “Welcome Back” emails!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But despite the fleeting moment of rest, I’m up and ready to hit the ground running this semester. My planner is already filled with assignments, lectures, and reminders, and I’m extremely excited to tackle everything on my to-do list. And, of course, I’m starting part two of my thesis/project capstone experience. I’m basically &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.spotify.com/album/1kCHru7uhxBUdzkm4gzRQc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;non-stop&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Things I&#8217;m Looking Forward To This Semester</title>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/5-things-im-looking-forward-to-this-semester</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I’m playing the waiting game with grad school applications, I’m extremely excited for everything else going on in Spring 2016. Here’s what’s happening:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Events and (Un)Conferences: I’m currently scheduled to attend &lt;a href=&quot;http://historycamp.org/boston-2016/&quot;&gt;History Camp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.brown.edu/hackingheritageunconference/&quot;&gt;Hacking Heritage&lt;/a&gt; in March. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umass.edu/history/about/writerinresidence.html&quot;&gt;Rebecca Onion is the Writer-in-Residence for UMass History&lt;/a&gt; this year, so I’m stoked!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thesis: I’ve been sharing my research story over at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honors.umass.edu/category/blog-column/taxonomy/term/717&quot;&gt;Honors Student Blog&lt;/a&gt;, and this semester will be all about the actual writing. I’ll also be working on the DH portion, and I expect this will take up the majority of my time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AppHuLL: The Applied Humanities Learning Lab is a Mellon-funded program intended to strengthen and clarify pathways from undergraduate humanities education to professional careers in the public and applied humanities. I’m one of fifteen Fellows this semester working with the Swift River Valley Historical Society. I just wrote a piece for &lt;a href=&quot;https://umasshistory.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/lessons-from-the-applied-humanities-learning-lab-2016/&quot;&gt;Past@Present&lt;/a&gt; about my experience in the J-term intensive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smith: In my quest to attend all of the Five Colleges, I only have one left! I’m taking two courses there this semester, exploring the Sophia Smith archives and material culture at Historic Deerfield.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UMass: It’s my last semester, and I plan to go out with a bang. I’m working on completing that &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuckyeaumass.tumblr.com/100Things&quot;&gt;senior-year bucket list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I shared my experience as a fellow in the Applied Humanities Learning Lab intensive over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://umasshistory.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/lessons-from-the-applied-humanities-learning-lab-2016/&quot;&gt;UMass History’s  past@present&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In its second year, the Applied Humanities Learning Lab (AppHuLL) seeks to take dynamic and motivated students and allow them to put into practice humanities skills on a _real _project. The course is half-career prep and half-project management – two vastly different goals, but both addressed in the four-day intensive. Of the course of January 11-14, we fifteen Fellows went from knowing nothing about the Quabbin Reservoir and its history to standing up as scholars and humanists in our own right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our first day, we walked out of the classroom daunted by what seemed an impossible task – I almost felt like I was invading a mostly-forgotten history protected by the few surviving persons. But we were welcomed – by great mentors Cheryl Harned and Mark Roblee, and most importantly, by the community members and leaders who helm the memory of these places today. Between field trips, conversations, activities, and workshops, we accomplished so much in learning where we stood and what we needed in order to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rev. Moses How</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/thesis/rev-moses-how/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-04T11:32:51-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/thesis/rev-moses-how</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading through the diaries of Reverend Moses How, who served as chaplain of the Seamen’s Bethel from 1844 to 1859.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Reading How’s diaries (there are several in the collection) isn’t as interesting as one may think – they read straightforward, more like a planner than the source of secrets. How visited jails, Sunday schools, Port Society meetings, and traveled around the south coast of Massachusetts to talk to numerous people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I first skimmed through the diaries, I saw tallies at the top of each page. Sometimes there were two or three lines – sometimes there were a few dozen. I didn’t think about those tallies until I started reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was keeping track of the number of funerals he had attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this devastating at first, how depressing it must have been for him. But then again, I couldn’t think much of it – he was a chaplain and reverend, it was regular responsibility in his line of work. How kept records of lots of things in each year of service – how many marriages he had performed, how many births in his congregation, how many sermons he had given and where they took place. But funerals were the only ones that are left with a permanent mark in his diary – a physical remnant of his counting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading How’s diaries to get a sense of his interactions with the seamen, though he doesn’t go into much detail. He was there for 14 years, but the strongest interactions he records are ones with dead men. It seems he struggled with his duties at the Bethel, trying to work for both the Port Society and to also carry out assistance to the seamen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am more and more convinced that any man who will be a true friend to the sailor and look out honestly for his temporal welfare will be unpopular with most of this — community. If I had known as much about the duties and difficulties attending as a pastor at the Seamen’s Bethel, as I do now, I am confident I should have never consented to go there, and now I see the wants of seamen, and their need of a friend they can confide in. I cannot bear the thought of leaving them, and yet, I sometimes think I cannot stay there any longer. I hope my heavenly Father will teach and guide me in the way I should go. &lt;/em&gt;(December 8, 1855)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, How was guided to stay, because he didn’t announce his resignation until late 1858:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I shall retire from my field of labor at the time you may designate, but not without feelings of deep anxiety for the prosperity of the Bethel, the Ladies’ Branch, and the Mariner’s Home, and earnest prayer that the abundance of the seas may be yet converted unto God. &lt;/em&gt;(October 21, 1858)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m moved by that first passage I came across – wondering what had happened for How to commit this to paper. Was this an outburst? Or was it a decades’ worth of experiences finally coming out? What are the “wants of seamen” that he was unable to provide?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve talked a lot in this class about how we remember Romans and Roman culture today, and we’ve talked about how Roman constructed their remembrance and image, and we’ve talked about how archaeologists contribute to the reconstruction of that memory. But we haven’t necessarily talked about these things in context of one another. Or at least, we haven’t as a class acknowledged how our assignments and our taking this class is a constant readjustment and remembrance of the Roman empire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Part of what this course does – especially thanks to the applications of DH – is illustrate the material history of the Roman world through art, architecture, and archaeological sites and bringing to the forefront the lives of “invisible” people (invisible in our time as well as theirs.) This course also has had explore the methods by which archaeologists discover and understand the classical past, and how these discoveries help establish the narrative of the Roman empire and its legacy. And so throughout our readings, lectures, and assignments, we’ve participated in the development of that interpretation of the value and importance of studying the Roman empire in the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Moral Voyage: Working Over Winter Break</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;See this stack of books? This is the pile that has been slowly accumulating on my desk over the course of the semester . Purchased on surprise trips to Amherst Books, the Odyssey Bookshop, or even the Campus Center Bookstore, these books have been taunting me throughout the semester as I’ve typed away on papers or trudged through dull readings. But I haven’t allowed myself to read them – not yet, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Winter break is supposed to be a time of relaxation – I’ll get to see my family, do a bit of traveling, and hopefully tackle this stack of books. (I’m really excited about Ron Chernow’s &lt;em&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; – I’m a sucker for anything related to the Founding Fathers.) I’m looking forward to sleeping in and being able to shift gears from all the academic work I’ve accomplished. I’ve worked hard and I’ve earned this break!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On My 20th Listen to Hamilton: Broadway &#038; Early American Republic</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/on-my-20th-listen-to-hamilton-broadway-early-american-republic/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-26T22:10:24-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/on-my-20th-listen-to-hamilton-broadway-early-american-republic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Okay, I lied. I haven’t listened to &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; 20 times. It’s probably much higher than that, considering for the first three weeks I was listening to it 2-3 times a day. And, for the first week, I listened to it for free on NPR, so let’s just go with at least 100 plays through the entire album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been raving about the Hamilton soundtrack since its release in September, just like everyone else has been talking about it all summer. It’s fresh, it’s new, it’s exciting. It’s been raved about for the acting, the lyrics, the man-myth-legend that is Lin-Manuel Miranda – you’d think I’d be &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;-ed out by now, but I’m not. (I haven’t had a chance to read Chernow’s biography yet, but it’s sitting on my desk, mocking me…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s one thing I haven’t seen people talk about regarding &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; yet: John Adams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John isn’t a role in the show – he’s barely mentioned. Miranda includes a tribute to 1776 in “The Adams Administration” and another mention of him in “I Know Him.” Most theatregoers have seen &lt;em&gt;1776&lt;/em&gt;, and know his significance either in regards to Jefferson or as the second President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s funny that Hamilton is the other founding father to get a leading role &lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;in a musical, especially with their history. Despite being of the same party, the two hated each other  and they both went to great lengths to ruin the other’s legacy because of the personal and public animosity – see the summary of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUI8b17YGx8&quot;&gt;Adams Pamphlet&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of Lin-Manuel Miranda. It wasn’t quite a clash of backgrounds (despite the obvious differences in their careers) but Adams saw Hamilton’s personality without integrity and virtue. He saw Hamilton as a scheming, prideful, man, a dangerous threat to the early republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1776&lt;/em&gt; gives us a snapshot, one moment of politics that explores the state of a not-yet nation. &lt;em&gt;1776&lt;/em&gt; is a story of how does one start a nation? Is it worth doing if it is not perfect?&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn2&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; asks us: how do we build off this momentum? How do we handle these imperfect beginnings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both try to humanize the founders, but they accomplish the task in vastly different ways. Sherman Edwards, the lyricist of 1776, “wanted to show [the founding fathers] at their outermost limits. These men were the cream of their colonies…They disagreed and fought with each other. But they understood commitment, and though they fought, they fought affirmatively.”&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn3&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton, on the other hand, says it explicitly: “this is not a moment/it’s the movement.” &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; shows us from 1776 to 1804, and it shows us all of the Revolution and Early Republic fervor – I mean, we spend the first half following the excitement of battles and duels and then the second act is like “how is he gonna get his plan through Congress I’m on the edge of my seat!” &lt;em&gt;1776&lt;/em&gt; never gives us that excitement – partly because we as an audience have a better understanding of what happened at Independence Hall, but also because it’s a story of settling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;1776&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; have us watch someone make their mark on history (whether literally on the Declaration or figuratively. But when I watch &lt;em&gt;1776&lt;/em&gt;, I watch it with the ending in mind the entire time, knowing the legacies of these men are cemented in place. It’s about a moment. Sherman Edwards did not intend for the show to become a sermon on the Declaration of Independence and the Founding Fathers, but it kinda was. In trying to show the founders as real people, telling their stories in context of the Declaration limits our ability to conceptualize them as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton’s legacies are less established. It’s not really in the genre of “founders chic” even if the founders play a part in the show – it’s more about the spirit of the era in a way that &lt;em&gt;1776&lt;/em&gt; can never address because of its goal. We see Hamilton as both immigrant and historical figure, we see his friends _literally _playing different roles, and we see the narrative of Hamilton’s life and rise to power through the eyes of those closest to him. And in that, we learn so much more than a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just a modern musical for its musical style. It’s using our conventions of history (our referring to the public in this case, and not historians) to tell a modern story that’s about more than representation, but about how the story of America’s revolutionary era is not the golden age of the founding fathers that we so often make it out to be. Leslie Odom Jr., who plays Aaron Burr, said it nicely here – “Our show is not about 1776. Our show is about 2015.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Encore! has announced that the 1776 revival will be a colorblind cast, I’m curious as to how the show will look different to us. It will certainly show us a thing or two about representation, but I’m not sure the core of the show will change. &lt;em&gt;1776&lt;/em&gt; is telling a completely different story about John Adams and the “cream” of the colonies, one in which race is an aspect of the story but not the focus. &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; relies on marginalized cultures to tell the story, and forces its audience to see whiteness – and its absence within its particular narrative, not just Broadway. In empathizing with Hamilton, within the early American republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, as a Broadway fan and a historian, I love them both. I love John Adams as a fellow Massachusetts resident, I love &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; because I see myself going nonstop like Hamilton. We’re looking at two musicals concerned with recreating and developing a legacy (within the show as well as outside of the show), looking at the men who know this is an opportunity for their ascendancy and how they shape that opportunity for the public memory. Viewers (or in the case of &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;, mostly listeners) are watching and interpreting the construction of American identity onstage – but we’re getting two vastly different stories of how we perform that identity in American popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftnref1&quot; name=&quot;_ftn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; Technically, Adams isn’t the leading role in 1776, as decided in the 1970 Tony Awards. But I’ll let it slide.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Moral Voyage: Proposal, Part 2 &#8211; The Syllabus</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honors.umass.edu/blog/eesten/moral-voyage-proposal-part-1-literature-review&quot;&gt;Last week&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about the proposal serving two purposes: the second of those two purposes being a syllabus for you, your committee, and the Honors College. I call it the syllabus section because it’s a lot easier to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; CHC is asking some of these questions, and also how to structure the proposal, when you think about it in that context. There are basically four parts: Method, Evaluation, Communication, and Timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How To Talk To People Who Aren&#8217;t Your Advisor About Your Thesis</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/thesis/how-to-talk-to-people-who-arent-your-advisor-about-your-thesis/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-22T06:30:06-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/thesis/how-to-talk-to-people-who-arent-your-advisor-about-your-thesis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By “who aren’t your advisor,” I really mean “people who have no idea about academia.” I’m still trying to nail down the best way to sum up my research without sounding like a walking thesaurus. I feel like each week there’s some new element I want to add or a new source takes me in a totally direction. I also feel like I have to give each person the background on my topic before I actually explain what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent conversation happened when my roommate’s family came to visit for the weekend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Roommate’s Parents: So what are you working on?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Me: Oh, I’m writing my thesis proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Roommate’s Parents: Oh, what’s it on?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Me: Well, I’m looking into this women’s organization called the Ladies’ Branch of the New Bedford Port Society and their reform efforts  to impose moral order on the transient seamen, within a gendered and racialized and class-related context … y’know, within a rapidly urbanizing whaling environment…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I realized I had been talking very quickly and kinda rambling and that my roommate’s parents were probably not that interested in my thesis and were probably making small talk, so I kinda just let my sentence die out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But trying to shorten my thesis into “I’m investigating women in whaling” doesn’t feel accurate, nor does saying “women in New Bedford” or “investigating social stratification in Jacksonian New England,” all of which are being addressed in this thesis but aren’t really the subject of what I’m looking at. Saying “I’m looking into the Ladies’ Branch for the New Bedford Port Society” usually just gives people blank stares, but feels less accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I did a pretty good job in&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lO5BFTgv9X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; this blog post&lt;/a&gt; summarizing myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My argument is that wealthy, Quaker women who participated in the organization used it as a way to contribute to their rapidly changing urban landscape by imposing moral standards on the transient seamen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it even simpler, I’ve been following one of my favorite blogs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tmblr.co/mi3NE51qZmj7zZW154gdlgw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@lolmythesis&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes I can think of a clever answer. If you can get your thesis into something as short and concise as that, I’d be impressed – it’s pretty difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I can recommend is that simple is best. Yes, you are very excited about your thesis – it’s basically dominating your academic life at this point. But channeling that excitement into a simple sentence makes your goal a lot clearer – and makes conversations a little bit easier to have with people who aren’t grading you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Moral Voyage: The Proposal, Part I &#8211; The Literature Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/a-moral-voyage-the-proposal-part-i-the-literature-review/"/>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;20 trips to the library, 14 books, 6 articles, 5 (surviving) recyclable bags from the circulation desk, and countless hours later, I can officially say that I have written my spring proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Essentially, to enroll in the spring semester of my honors thesis, I have to fill out a proposal. I did something similar to register for the fall semester, but this proposal is a much more involved and in-depth process. The proposal serves two purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It’s proof that this first semester of research hasn’t gone to waste – that I know what I’m talking about regarding the topic, that I know why it’s relevant and important to historians, and that I know that this is new and original research.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It’s a syllabus – it gives a general overview of the thesis, what it will accomplish, and the dates and deadlines for a first draft and subsequent drafts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Do You Wanna Write A Thesis?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/thesis/do-you-wanna-write-a-thesis/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-15T14:37:05-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/thesis/do-you-wanna-write-a-thesis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am by no means an authority on the subject of an undergrad thesis. That’s exactly why I’m starting this next series of posts. I’m documenting this project as a reverse guide to myself – for when I try to do this again for my MA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like there are a lot of ‘firsts’ that I’ve been through in undertaking this assignment – not because I didn’t have people to ask, but because it’s hard to find &amp;amp; connect with people who are going through the same stages. Often times, these questions seemed like stupidly obvious ones, but still ones that needed to be answered. A lot of the tutorials out there are made for grad students, who already have a leg up in some sense and have been through the motions of this before. I was looking for square one – simple answers for simple questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next couple weeks, I hope you’ll join me on my thesis adventure as I cover the basics of research. I’m writing similar issues on another blog, and so I’ll share those links here too. Mostly, I want to be able to document my thesis process in multiple ways – the questions I’ve had being a key component of that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: For those of you who have followed my work for a long time, you’ll have noticed I shifted from Tumblr to WordPress for this work. While I still have Tumblr for personal use I feel it’s not the best platform for what I want to do in an academic sense. I’m not a huge fan of WordPress, but it’s better suited for this kind of blogging. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Moral Voyage: Selecting Your Committee</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve heard it said that the difference between success and failure is a great team. In that case, I have an &lt;strong&gt;amazing&lt;/strong&gt; team – er, committee – working with me, ready to advise and guide my progress through the thesis, so I should definitely be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I first started the proposal process back in March, I went to Professor Miller with the vague outline of an idea. I trusted her judgment and her expertise, knowing that she had a better idea of who in the department would best fit this topic. She suggested a few names, who I then contacted and sat down with to discuss my work. I wanted to find someone who could strengthen the themes and big ideas of my thesis – race, gender, and women’s movements – and who had the time to work with me on a 1:1 level regularly. I finally decided on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umass.edu/history/people/faculty/lovett.html&quot;&gt;Professor Laura Lovett&lt;/a&gt; to serve as my Committee Chair – after reading through some of her work and getting to know her, she seemed really excited about the prospects of my research and in helping me take the thesis in a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>A Moral Voyage: Making Time</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From Honors Student Blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I feel like this last week has been especially busy, what with midterms and papers and Halloween. And now it’s November – class registration is starting, final assignments are being discussed, and Thanksgiving break is just off in the distance. How did this semester fly by so quickly?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And of course, on top of classwork and social engagements, I still have a lot of work to do for my thesis. Juggling research on top of a busy semester is definitely doable, but it’s not really something you can put down or work on occasionally. It requires regular attention – something that is hard to do when so many other assignments or activities are happening at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is a picture of my binder. More specifically, this is &lt;strong&gt;THE BINDER&lt;/strong&gt;, the one that holds every piece of information for HIST 499Y. It corresponds with a folder on my computer, but as they say in library sciences,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/l/lots-of-copies-keep-stuff-safe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; lots of copies keep stuff safe&lt;/a&gt;!

   <title>A Great &#038; Mighty Theme (Revised)</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/a-great-mighty-theme-revised/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-21T15:38:08-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/a-great-mighty-theme-revised</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to expand on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honors.umass.edu/blog/eesten/moral-voyage-mighty-theme&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; first, because I didn’t have such a straightforward way of coming up with a topic. I mean, it did sort of start that way, but not quite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have followed this blog know &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/84017941251/the-last-lecture&quot;&gt;I’m from the greater New Bedford area&lt;/a&gt; – I’ve talked about that before. I’ve also talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/tagged/history+298&quot;&gt;my work with Dr. Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/95819731502/summer-in-the-library&quot;&gt;my internship at the New Bedford Whaling Museum,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/90180268567/cwm&quot;&gt;my love for the &lt;em&gt;Charles W. Morgan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use my thesis as a chance to expand on my work in New Bedford – to sort of prove that all this research I’ve been doing was leading up to something of my own. I didn’t want my random details about the whaling industry to be for naught!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered thinking about one of my assignments in the research library, when I was reading about &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwhalingmuseumblog.org%2F2014%2F07%2F21%2Fmatthew-and-rachel-howland%2F&amp;amp;t=OTUwMmU4OGI2MjA5ODhkMWU5NjNiNzc5MGYwZDMwYjkwNmIwNmI1YixmbVNuaEZJeg%3D%3D&quot;&gt;the Howlands&lt;/a&gt;. I was really interested in their relationship, mainly because of how important the Howlands were to the city both during and after whaling. In all my time in whaling, I’d almost forgotten that New Bedford was an actual city – that people lived here all the time, that there were so many other things going on. And reading about Rachel Howland – the wife of Matthew Howland and the “queen” of New Bedford society – gave me the opportunity to start thinking about the community as a whole. The city was completely transformed by the whaling industry, and while it’s practically defined by it today, I wondered the rest of society apart from those directly involved in the industry handled the changes it brought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping that in mind, I started looking into New Bedford society, though my initial thesis proposal focused a lot more on women &amp;amp; the whaling industry than I now have planned. With a little bit of digging around and help from a lot of historians, I was able to take what I was interested in bring it in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;No matter when you start your CHC career, one goal looms in the distance: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honors.umass.edu/capstone-experience&quot;&gt;the senior thesis&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not a requirement per se, but it’s highly encouraged that students write one as conclusion to the CHC experience, and it’s been one of my goals since coming to UMass. But as I’m starting to learn in the process, you don’t really know how to write a thesis until you dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Past@Present: Closing the Gap: Frequently Asked Questions at the John Brown House Museum</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/closing-the-gap-frequently-asked-questions-at-the-john-brown-house-museum/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-23T22:41:51-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/closing-the-gap-frequently-asked-questions-at-the-john-brown-house-museum</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I shared my experience as an intern for the John Brown House Museum in Providence, RI over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://umasshistory.wordpress.com/2015/09/24/closing-the-gap-frequently-asked-questions-at-the-john-brown-house-museum/&quot;&gt;UMass History’s  past@present&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I interned at the John Brown House Museum (JBH) in Providence, RI this summer. Interning in a small historic house museum allowed me to be a jack-of-all-trades. I opened and closed the museum, followed and guided tours, attended meetings, met with docents, assisted at events, create education packets…essentially, a little bit of everything.&lt;a href=&quot;https://umasshistory.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_0116.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But the most important task I dealt with on a day-to-day basis was manning the front desk. As the first person patrons would see prior to entering the museum, I handled all their questions. Over the course of the summer, I had a running FAQ list of statements I had heard far too often, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Is this John Brown the abolitionist? (No.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Do you allow photography? (Yes, no flash.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Is this museum affiliated with the University? (No.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Where’s the bathroom? (To your left.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What’s the square footage of the house? (8,000)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What time do you close? (4 PM)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Wrapping Up Spring Semester</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/wrapping-up-spring-semester/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-31T20:41:14-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/wrapping-up-spring-semester</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been home for a few weeks and I haven’t been writing for my blog. But that’s not for lack of information – it’s just taking me a bit longer to settle down and get my words on screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime however, I wanted to to talk about &amp;amp; link to a few events this semester that I didn’t get a chance to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/I6i3wDSwwoY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Roopika Risam&lt;/a&gt; explored critical and postcolonial digital humanities, and the challenges presented by the limits of postcolonial theory for DH. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://storify.com/5cDH/5colldh-speaker-series-roopika-risam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;storify&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/c6BZ6f_dWog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;D. Fox Harrell&lt;/a&gt; discussed the computational narrative and social empowerment – I wrote more about his talk here. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://storify.com/5cDH/5colldh-speaker-series-d-fox-harrell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;storify&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/M9zkTTLLnDs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miriam Posner&lt;/a&gt;, coordinator of the Digital Humanities Program at UCLA, discussed her most recent project on photography and lobotomy, while discussing ethics of DH projects. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://storify.com/5cDH/5colldh-speaker-series-miriam-posner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;storify&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://symposium.5colldh.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The undergraduate fellows for Five College Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt; presented their projects and accomplishments at the Student Symposium. They all blew me away with their presentations which covered topics like queer horror, Pompeii, and public robotics.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.umass.edu/events/angela-davis-sustaining-social-justice-movements&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Angela Davis&lt;/a&gt; spoke to the UMass community about the prison-industrial complex, protest movements, and institutional change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An Evening With Museums was an event hosted by the UMass English department that invited museum professionals to talk about how skills of English majors can be applied to the museum field. I met Alexandra Kennedy of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlemuseum.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eric Carle Museum&lt;/a&gt;, Margaret Powell of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winterthur.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Winterthur Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and Jane Wald of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Emily Dickinson Museum&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom discussed what they do, how they got there, and what college graduates can do to enter the museum world. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My English 350 class met with professionals in and out of the publishing industry to discuss their experiences and talk about the future of digital publishing. We spoke with Charlotte Roh and David Toomey of UMass, and alum Molly Bashaw who now works at Penguin Random House.  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>HIST 397VW: Mill River Greenway Initiative</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/hist-397vw-mill-river-greenway-initiative/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-10T10:01:12-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/hist-397vw-mill-river-greenway-initiative</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my studies, I find it extremely&lt;br /&gt;
important for my understanding of a particular topic to be able to connect with&lt;br /&gt;
something tangible.  This semester, my&lt;br /&gt;
Public History Workshop worked with a local organization, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://millrivergreenway.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mill&lt;br /&gt; River Greenway Initiative (MRGI),&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to develop interpretive panels for an&lt;br /&gt;
exhibit. The balance of environmental history lectures and working directly in&lt;br /&gt;
the field allowed me to understand and interpret the local history of&lt;br /&gt;
Northampton.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our semester-long project, my class developed this six-panel exhibit to document various aspects of the river’s history. I chose&lt;br /&gt;
to work on two sections: the study the racial diversity, reform movements, and&lt;br /&gt;
early industry along the Mill River, and the history of floods and civil&lt;br /&gt;
engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons&lt;br /&gt;
in working on the first panel was integrating our classwork with other local&lt;br /&gt;
organizations. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historic-northampton.org/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Historic Northampton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidrugglescenter.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Ruggles Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; had&lt;br /&gt;
already tackled the racial diversity and abolitionist efforts I hoped to&lt;br /&gt;
investigate in the panel; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smith.edu/hsc/silk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smith College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; addressed&lt;br /&gt;
sericulture and the silk manufacturing business. My partner and I reviewed&lt;br /&gt;
these established projects – both for their information and structure – in&lt;br /&gt;
order to understand the topics addressed and the language used for an exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the civil engineering panel, my&lt;br /&gt;
partner and I looked into the historic Mill River flood of 1874, the hurricane&lt;br /&gt;
of 1938, and the subsequent diversion of the Mill River in 1940 by the Army&lt;br /&gt;
Corps of Engineers. We wanted to investigate how over time, engineers control nature to suit human living patterns by designing and constructing public works projects, like dams and bridges for rivers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the facts I&lt;br /&gt;
learned during the course of this project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Early industry along the Mill River was a direct&lt;br /&gt;
result of the First Industrial Revolution, where dozens of textile mill owners&lt;br /&gt;
built along the river to take advantage of its strong flow throughout the year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Northampton was best known for its involvement&lt;br /&gt;
in the silk industry. This Smith exhibit made by Dr. Marjorie Senechal goes&lt;br /&gt;
into great detail on some of the processes to make silk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Known as the “Paradise City,” Northampton became&lt;br /&gt;
a haven for reformers pursuing utopian and humanitarian efforts, as they worked&lt;br /&gt;
together for social and economic equality and the end of slavery in the United&lt;br /&gt;
States. One of these utopian efforts was the Northampton Association for&lt;br /&gt;
Education &amp;amp; Industry – you can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historic-northampton.org/highlights/educationindustry.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read&lt;br /&gt; more about that here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This historic Mill River flood of 1874 was the&lt;br /&gt;
first major dam disaster in the United States, with 600 million gallons of&lt;br /&gt;
water pouring over the land and destroying everything in its path.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Mill River was prone to harsh flooding,&lt;br /&gt;
especially in the 1930s due to the snowfall of 1936 and the hurricane of 1938.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to prevent floodwaters from disrupting life in the Northampton&lt;br /&gt;
downtown area, the Army Corps of Engineers came to a solution that diverted the&lt;br /&gt;
river away from the center of town.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our final assignment for the semester,&lt;br /&gt;
my class had to present our proposal at a public forum. I found this&lt;br /&gt;
opportunity to be a great opportunity, and I appreciated the feedback from&lt;br /&gt;
members of the community. Their comments and critiques helped my classmates and&lt;br /&gt;
me frame our work and gave us valuable insights into the needs of the&lt;br /&gt;
community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed working with John and&lt;br /&gt;
Gaby of MRGI. They have lots of ideas for the future of the Initiative and&lt;br /&gt;
while they have loads of work moving forward, I hope to see the organization&lt;br /&gt;
succeed in bringing people back to the river and establishing the greenway. I&lt;br /&gt;
hope that our class’s collaboration with the MRGI has been as valuable for them&lt;br /&gt;
as it has been for me, and I can’t wait to see what’s in store for the&lt;br /&gt;
semester’s worth of hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this class served two&lt;br /&gt;
purposes. In the first half of the semester, we received a crash course in the&lt;br /&gt;
history of the Pioneer Valley, environmental history, and the Connecticut River&lt;br /&gt;
watershed. In the second half of the semester, we learned how to apply our&lt;br /&gt;
newfound knowledge directly to the Mill River and work with John and Gaby in&lt;br /&gt;
creating a presentation of this history. While at times this course required&lt;br /&gt;
time and effort, the invaluable practical experience involved taught me the&lt;br /&gt;
importance of historic site interpretation and working with a community.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Steps to a Successful #ResearchDay</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/5-steps-to-a-successful-researchday/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-19T13:01:23-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/5-steps-to-a-successful-researchday</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the perks of being a humanities major is the NO FINAL EXAM notice I see on every syllabus. However, that perk comes at a price – the independent research project, of which I currently have three to finish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my professors, who have been off at conferences over the past two weeks, have graciously offered “research time” in lieu of class, which is supposed to be spent getting all of the necessary materials together so that the paper isn’t as stressful in those last few days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am the type of person who likes to devote large chunks of time to a project in order to tackle as much of the workload as possible. And so “research time” isn’t very valuable to me when it’s just an hour set aside. But when all of the designated “research time” classes end up on the same day, I’m left with the glorious concept of #ResearchDay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had or created a #ResearchDay for myself each semester, and so I’ve somewhat developed a few guidelines to help me have a successful and productive day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment:&lt;/strong&gt; I am normally the type of person who can do work anywhere – on a bus or in my room, with the TV on or with complete silence. But on a Research Day, I like to create a very specific environment that has little distractions. For me, that means one of two places: either my desk with headphones providing white noise, or the magnificent DuBois Library, with headphones playing NPR. Note: Everyone has a different environment for productivity. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materials:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to bring everything that you need for the day – you’ll be there a while! This includes flash drives, books, notebooks, and music, if you’d like. But make sure you only bring the absolute essentials to your workspace. You don’t want to overload yourself with books or articles and find yourself stressed from the workload. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;: Setting clear and concise goals for your Research Day is key to being successful. Be realistic about what you can accomplish in one day, and make sure it fits into your overall timeline for the semester. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break:&lt;/strong&gt; Now that you have large goals for the day, you should make sure to step back every once in a while so that your workload doesn’t consume you. I like to take five minute breaks between articles and twenty-minute snack breaks before switching projects.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate:&lt;/strong&gt; After a long research day, don’t go home and do more work (as I am prone to do.) Instead, congratulate yourself on a job well done and take the rest of the time as a “me day” and relax. There’s always more work to do, but you have accomplished a lot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m wishing all of you best of luck as we get to the end of the semester!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What I Learned About Myself in English 302</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/english-302/what-i-learned-about-myself-in-english-302/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-16T21:53:51-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/english-302/what-i-learned-about-myself-in-english-302</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/04/modern_communication_technology_flat_illustration_by_cursorch-d72tm9f.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; size-medium wp-image-3929 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/04/modern_communication_technology_flat_illustration_by_cursorch-d72tm9f-253x300.jpg?resize=253%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;modern_communication_technology_flat_illustration_by_cursorch-d72tm9f&quot; width=&quot;253&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aspiring digital historian, I always find it weird to be living in two worlds at once. My work and play are intertwined; I find myself constantly bouncing between past and future, and I find it to be perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English 302 has helped me – I think – to further blur those lines, but also made me think about why the field of DH/New Media has become a priority for me. It’s always been clear to me why I’ve loved history, long before I declared my history major. But while digital culture and new media have been a presence in my life for as long as I can remember, it’s only been quite recently that I started to take it on in an academic fashion. This course helped me reevaluate my decision to actively investigate new media, rather than just be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, this class has taught me about _how _I use the Internet – and consequently, how the Internet uses me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It placed things like memes – which are a key component of Internet humor – in context with philosophy of simulacra and replication. The constant presence and cyclical nature of the meme is not necessarily a new concept, but one that is highlighted in the quick-sharing, visual nature of the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our discussions of Google and Amazon probably should have frightened me off of these platforms, and they momentarily made me question why I have used them so blindly. In my notes for our Google discussion, I have written in my notes that “Google is My Portal to the Internet.” I’ve developed a form of brand loyalty with both of these platforms, and it _“seems” _like they have it in return due to the “emphasis of you” strategy. Should I be worried? Should I be concerned?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And our discussion of YouTube – especially since it has been Team Tubular’s task to tackle for the semester – has really got me thinking about the way we broadcast ourselves. Our self presence on the Internet has long been a concern for parents of Millenials, as it’s been unclear how it will affect the way the world sees us. But the formations of community, self-understanding,  and issues of representation are all seriously interesting things to consider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think I have developed a better understanding of the “back-end” of the platforms and systems and Internet culture that I use everyday. In talking about the theory and practice of new media, I felt that we kept circling back to one term – &lt;em&gt;DIY Culture&lt;/em&gt;. It seems that we as users in the digital age crave the democracy and power given to us in a DIY culture. And when big business tries to take it away from us in any way, shape, or form, we try to fight back. We are creating and destroying, theorizing and analyzing, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that the DIY nature of the digital age requires us to be active and interactive participants in the world of new media. And even more so, I think the DIY nature requires us to actively review and investigate this new turf on our own terms – as users and as academics. New media is like &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, as we referenced so many times earlier in the semester. But we can’t escape it in our analysis or our critique, because it’s so much a part of who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I think that’s why I’ve been so excited in investigating the study of new media so intensely over the past year, and certainly more so in taking this course – I have to be. It’s my duty as an Internet user and as a participant in new media. If DIY is our rallying cause, then I guess have I to take up this academic analysis of new media myself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>TV Isn&#8217;t Dead &#8211; It&#8217;s Just Inactive</title>

   <updated>2015-04-16T21:53:16-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/english-302/tv-isnt-dead-its-just-inactive</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/04/TV-is-Dead.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-3921&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/04/TV-is-Dead-300x221.jpg?resize=300%2C221&quot; alt=&quot;TV-is-Dead&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week , we discussed our relationships with television. Is it dead? How does it fit into our lives? Does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are big questions, and I came to this conclusion: TV is not dead, it’s just inactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my family home, we doesn’t really _watch _television – we have it on as background noise as we go about our day. Out of any of us, it’s probably my mother and stepfather who watch TV the most. He normally watches live events like Sunday football, or obscure sci-fi movies. And even then, my stepfather ends up sleeping through most of these shows, so I can’t really say that any of us &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actively &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;watches TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the three people in my suite, I’m probably the one who uses the television the most. I like to have it on as white noise when I’m in the room, as a distraction when I’m doing homework, and occasionally have a show that I’ll watch live because I’m actually interested in it. But the type of shows that I watch on television are certainly not “quality” television – it’s usually an ABC Family drama like &lt;em&gt;Chasing Life&lt;/em&gt;, a rerun of &lt;em&gt;Friends _or _How I Met Your Mother&lt;/em&gt;, or whatever happens to be on HBO tonight. What I put on for background noise isn’t something I’m invested in. Again, TV is &lt;strong&gt;inactive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’m watching something because I’m invested in it – television show, web show, web series, what have you – I’ll watch it on some other device. Normally that’s my computer, but it could also be my Kindle or my phone, depending on the location and whether I’m trying to multitask. If I want something on a bigger screen, I’ll hook up my HDMI cord to the TV in my suite. I watch a lot of things this way – some of them just regular televisions shows, but also old shows or webseries that I can bingewatch my way through. (If I had more room, I would write about bingewatching, since that’s a whole different subject that we didn’t get to talk about in class but I think is especially relevant in the conversation about television vs. Internet.) And better yet, I can watch them on my own time – not at the whim of TV guide everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer these shows, especially YouTube series, because I’m a part of them. I financially support them by purchasing their merchandise or donating to the Kickstarter. I interact with the stars and producers. And overall, these shows are just &lt;em&gt;better &lt;/em&gt;– they’re new and original and more in-tune with my life and my interests and they’re easy to share with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have long called the television an “idiot box” – and I don’t necessarily think they’re right in that description. But, like in Professor Russworm’s article, TV is not productive work or play – it’s just a constant presence that doesn’t do much for me anymore. On the other hand, the Internet is filled with new and exciting ideas, videos and series that I can invest it. Web series (or anything on the web, for that matter) are &lt;strong&gt;active &lt;/strong&gt;and engaging places of media. They’re &lt;strong&gt;new media!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s getting to the end of the semester, but a lot of stuff has been happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I’m Doing: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My internship at UMass Press has been going well – I’ve spent the majority of my semester developing their new blog, which was launched earlier this week. It’s given me a chance to really delve into scholarly publishing and research a number of publications by the Press in the last few years. Check out the blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/GGpAXVbbjn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I went to see Angela Davis last Monday! As expected, she was a phenomenal speaker greeted by a standing ovation before and after her presentation. The &lt;em&gt;Massachusetts Daily Collegian&lt;/em&gt; has a good summary of the key points in her address. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also went to the Five College Digital Humanities Speaker Series presentation with D. Fox Harrell – you can read my reflection &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/2015/04/03/d-fox-harrell-phantasmal-media/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;or the Storify by 5CollDH &lt;a href=&quot;https://storify.com/5cDH/5colldh-speaker-series-d-fox-harrell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I got to &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wakIboBEFn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;use Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;, despite it being way past its prime. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I’m Reading: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qb0SulJCjO&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“How Do You Design the Library of the Future?” by Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; – What is the history of the library? How do we use it today? Where is it headed? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/rRID4XCCiP&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Museums: Getting in the Game” – Digital Public History&lt;/a&gt; – What do museums (or really, GLAMs) think of digitization?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/F6hlmd5dd6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“’Jews Aren’t Allowed to Use Phones’: Berlin’s Most Unsettling Memorial” by Ian Johnson &lt;/a&gt;– A thought-provoking public history experiment. &lt;/li&gt;

   <updated>2015-04-02T21:52:40-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/english-302/d-fox-harrell-phantasmal-media</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/04/CBiV4CmWEAAiLln.jpg-large.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-3779&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/04/CBiV4CmWEAAiLln.jpg-large-225x300.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;CBiV4CmWEAAiLln.jpg-large&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I was very excited to visit Amherst College for the Five College Digital Humanities Speaker Series lecture by D. Fox Harrell. I had been disappointed that I was going to miss the lecture due to class, so being able to go made my day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Five College Digital Humanities Speaker Series has been a great experience over the past year, as an accessible way for scholars of all educational levels to be introduced to the theoretical aspects of digital humanities. I had a vague idea of what ‘Digital Selves in Phantasmal Media” was going to be about – social media, identity, video games, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I had difficulty distinguishing the difference between a phantasm and a meme (by its initial definition – not the fun graphics kind.) However, his explanation with the “ladies” sign cleared up my confusion – memes are the units of information/concepts of culture hat inform or behavior, while phantasms are the placement of the meme onto a visual image. Phantasms are sort of like the result of a real-life coding situation: the back-end is our cultural values and traditions, while the front-end is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are phantasms important to the digital world? Well, much of our identities (if not all of our identities) on the Internet or in other computational media are constructed through phantasmal means. Identity is a complex sociological concept in the physical world – think WEB DuBois’s concept of “double consciousness” – and so the same type of issue exponentionally develops when you try bring that to th internet. As we’ve discussed in class, it’s one thing for us to go onto the Internet in hopes to conceal an identity. But as Harrell pointed out, our social identities are implemented across platforms, and so when we move onto social media or video games, we bring the issues of identity with us. One cannot truly “leave your identity behind” online – the algorithms we use to shop, talk, and play on the Internet embody and perpetuate inherent values and traditions of the culture and society in which they were created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/04/Chimeria.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; size-medium wp-image-3907 alignleft&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/04/Chimeria-300x161.jpg?resize=300%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;Chimeria&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;161&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve now played through Chimeria a few a times –once in the walkthrough of _Gatekeeper _Harrell gave us during the lecture, and then a few times with the social media version on the ICE lab website. It still feels like traditional computational media to me – whether that’s lack of experience with games or the limitations of game development, I’m not sure. But there’s a definitely a sense from playing _Gatekeeper _that the game and the game mechanics are invested in you as a user – that the system is learning from your actions, and it more accurately represents interactions than I have ever seen in media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated by the term _cultural computing. _I think that Harrell’s work is a valuable addition to the scholarship of cultural media, and will greatly contribute to the development of computational media in social circles. Narratives, gaming, and digital media have sorted our identities into pieces. What is parsed together on technical levels is an encoding of social structures – the phantasms we recognize and interpret on a daily basis. Harrell’s research combines ideas of cultural meaning with computational media – and I can’t wait to see where it takes our understanding of the digital world.cept of “double consciousness” – and so the same type of issue exponentially develops when you try bring that to th internet. As we’ve discussed in class, it’s one thing for us to go onto the Internet in hopes to conceal an identity. But as Harrell pointed out, our social identities are implemented across platforms, and so when we move onto social media or video games, we bring the issues of identity with us. One cannot truly “leave your identity behind” online – the algorithms we use to shop, talk, and play on the Internet embody and perpetuate inherent values and traditions of the culture and society in which they were created.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>&#8220;Freedom on the Move&#8221;</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/freedom-on-the-move/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-08T13:14:53-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/freedom-on-the-move</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know I haven’t had the chance to really dive into my classwork in a blog post for awhile, so I thought I’d take the chance this week to talk about the fascinating project I’ve been working on for my Junior Year Writing course. The course is primarily focused on Black women’s political activism during the nineteenth century, so we’re exploring the antebellum period through the early 1900s in terms of local and national political engagement. We’re also thinking about some of the main questions historians consider when theorizing, writing, or researching Black women and politics. The “Freedom on the Project” allows us to investigate the information written between the lines of the advertisements: what were these women’s experiences? What were their fears? What did self-liberation entail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we started out the semester sitting and discussing works about the politics of race and freedom, these past two weeks have been devoted to something a little different. Instead, we’ve been working with a crowdsourced project by Cornell University called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://freedomonthemove.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freedom on the Move&lt;/a&gt;.” Essentially, it’s a database of runaway slave advertisements in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who has viewed a lot of crowdsourced projects, I find the “Freedom on the Move” project to be a quality database with a lot of potential. Its features are fairly limited at the moment, but the ability to view and compare North American fugitives through statistical, geographical, and textual analysis will be a great contribution to researchers’ understanding of enslaved people in United States history. However, while these advertisements showcase a great deal about the history of slavery on an individual level, the database’s faults make it difficult for one clear narrative to emerge regarding the experiences of enslaved and self-liberated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest concern with the database is that is currently unable to recognize repetitive advertisements. Sometimes, subscribers would post the same ad over the course of several days or months in hopes of finding information about an individual. The system, however, recognizes each ad as a unique entry. While the tagging system could solve this issue by linking specific tags to similar advertisements, crowdsourcing makes it difficult to ensure the application of uniform tags onto each advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More relevant to my concerns as a researcher, the data parser struggles between giving voice to enslaved peoples’ lives and enslavers’ desires. Crowdsourcing is good for quickly gathering data and taking down key information – all the statistical data, that is – but when reading between the lines, lots of questions emerge. It’s unclear what sort of “rich semantic data” the programmers are looking for – the major categories of “Newspaper,” “Enslaver,” “Runaway,” “Event,” and “Children” seem geared towards a specific type of advertisement that emphasizes context. The data parser asks multiple questions about enslaved people escaping mid-transition, though such a case never came up in my research. There’s also a strange emphasis on self-liberated people traveling together, as the data parser wants to know who they were traveling with and how many children the person had. Sometimes, it seems like the database is looking for unnecessary information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite its faults, I really enjoyed working with this database. I particularly found the “Committed” advertisements to be the most interesting, as they generated the least amount of information for the database. The data parser is biased towards enslavers looking for self-liberated people, and so the questions typically revolve around physical descriptions and locations. However, the “Committed” advertisements like those of Sheriff J. Bates Jr. in the Mobile Register present extremely limited descriptions of the people in the Mobile County Jail. These ads give little insight into what a person looks like, what their motive for liberation may have been, even where they come from at times. These ads are entirely distrustful of an enslaved person’s perspective, evident through the subtle use of words such as “calls himself” or “says.” But it also generated a lot of questions for me about the process of slavery – how would a slaveholder “prove property?” What sort of information would a sheriff demand of a person in their custody? As a class, we were trying to use the database to find advertisements by slaveholders and subscribers – transcriptions that identify a person, and not property. But “Committed” advertisements write Black people strictly into narratives of property, making the historical process more complex as we attempt to uncover and emphasize Black voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the data collected through Cornell University’s “Freedom on the Move” project gives researchers greater access to valuable materials. It also encourages users to consider these advertisements in a broader context, helping to draw out narratives not necessarily obvious in the data presented. These newspapers tell us a more complete story of how slavery, self-liberation, and the individuals moving in and out of the system chose to embody freedom in a physical way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The &#8220;Humanity Factor&#8221; of Platforms</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/the-humanity-factor-of-platforms/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-04T20:51:41-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/the-humanity-factor-of-platforms</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we were discussing our team illustrations, I noticed that all of the boards explaining how platforms work featured stick-figure people. While the people figured into the equation in different ways depending on the team’s artistic interpretation, those little stick figures were all directly involved with the use of the platform. I’m pointing this out not because this assignment was supposed to showcase our drawing skills, but it highlights something that we all identified in our explanations of platforms – that in order to be means of connection or consumerism or presentation, there has to be some involvement on our part. Twitter as a social media platform allows our voices and our hashtags to find a community. Amazon as a shopping platform connects businesses and entrepreneurs with prospective markets. While could argue that platforms are about presenting ideas and products, the true value of platforms is about bringing &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt; closer together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “humanity factor” of platforms is the most important aspect – and that’s why saying that platforms encourage desocialization is difficult to comprehend. Platforms are inherently social – as powerful ecosystems, they’re designed to develop and incorporate new planks in order to connect individuals to things greater than themselves, whether that means products, causes, or audiences. They are public spaces in which we interact on some level with the world. And in the formation of public spaces, whether it is a conscious or subconscious action, we create identities in these spaces that have social meanings. And so public spaces become racialized and gendered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some web platforms allow and encourage anonymity, that doesn’t necessarily eliminate socialization. We talked about Google two weeks ago as collecting and aggregating data on us to create a digital self and to place emphasis on “you.” As much as we wish we could claim anonymity on the Internet, it’s just not true. This racialization and gendering process occurs despite anonymity, because as we interact with social platforms, we still recreate some form the self to foster symbiotic and mutually beneficial relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon may seem just like a multifaceted business, with its Amazon Instant Video beside the Kindle Store and Direct Publishing next to Imdb, but it’s lazy thinking to believe that’s all Amazon is. In its attempts to create a singularity, Amazon is also creating a public space that operates along specific guidelines and social norms. By carefully cultivating planks that will benefit the evolution of the business, Amazon has constructed a place on which the “humanity factor” has to interact within these social norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platforms filter our Internet experience as consumers, producers, and as voices in a digital environment. The so-called Gang of Four needs our participation as a user base to function and thrive as they monopolize the Internet. But we have to consider what it means for our humanity when we are utilizing Web 2.0 platforms. As stated in Gillepsie’s “The politics of ‘platforms’,” ‘platforms’ are ‘platforms’ because they afford us an opportunity to communicate, interact or sell (Gillespie 351). We have to be careful that the self that surfs the Internet is a self that we want to represent us, and is not just the result of platform influence.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>YouTube Is About Community</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/english-302/youtube-is-about-community/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-18T20:50:52-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/english-302/youtube-is-about-community</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;!--YouTube Error: bad URL entered--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first three videos on this list are all Harry-Potter related, which I think tells two things about me: 1) that I love Harry Potter (especially around the time of these videos, when Book 7 was about to be released) and 2) my initial Internet experiences involved expanding on my interests. While the first statement is still true, the second statement describes how I interact with YouTube today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment has been YouTube’s prerogative from the beginning, I think – music and videos and funny webseries are what the site is best known for. So I included a few of those on my list – but I tried not to go for the big and famous artists (save Ed Sheeran, whose “You Need Me, I Don’t Need You” video is still my favorite music video ever.) Instead, I went for the people that have written or covered songs in new ways that have gone viral, but ultimately keep going for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also notice that the majority of this list is from the Vlogbrothers channel or is affiliated with the channel (see CrashCourse, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, The Art Assignment, and hankgames.) While I watched YouTube before being introduced to John and Hank Green of Vlogbrothers, it wasn’t until I started binge-watching their channel that YouTube became a part of my daily life. (And if you don’t know who the Vlogbrothers are, I suggest you google them or check out their &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VlogBrothers&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;.) I joined the Nerdfighter bandwagon in high school, and while they’re no longer the only channel I watch, they make up a big part of YouTube life. They are creators at heart, truly representing what used to be YouTube’s slogan – “Broadcast Yourself.” Their way of looking at the world has helped me find my new interests and reinvigorated my old ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And mostly thanks to Vlogbrothers, education is a huge part of my YouTube experience. I love learning and exploring and discovering new things, and watching channels like PBS Digital Studios and The Brain Scoop have allowed me to pursue educational interests outside of my major requirements for free – something not always available here at UMass. I’ve watched Emily Graslie skin a wolf and explain the process of taxidermy. I’ve debated with Mike Rugnetta over the philosophy of Internet culture. I’ve discovered the history of contemporary art with Sarah Urist Green and learned about the artistic process. I’ve learned the basics about astronomy and biology and chemistry (all sciences I never jumped for joy about in high school) alongside my actual interests like world and American history. When I come to YouTube, I’m looking for experiences that can broaden my horizons – and entertain me while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I had to pick one word to describe what my YouTube is all about, I’d have to pick &lt;strong&gt;community&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether you’re a musician or an educator or just someone vlogging about your daily life, YouTube is a platform that encourages creativity and relationships between creators and viewers. I feel like I have a personal relationship with these creators on some level – I interact with them through comments, I’ve tweeted and reblogged their posts, I’ve even donated to some of their campaigns and projects. And I’ve met people because of my love of YouTube personalities or videos. YouTube is a form of entertainment unlike anything else I use, because it’s all about involving myself at a personal level – it’s new media at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, also – make sure you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;amp;list=PLjYx3V-2ouwAbefrAhv0uxOXvs8v8AnN2&amp;amp;index=4&quot;&gt;watch video #4&lt;/a&gt; on my list.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Conditional Love Letter to Google</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/english-302/a-conditional-love-letter-to-google/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-18T20:37:50-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/english-302/a-conditional-love-letter-to-google</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My beloved Google,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/02/i-love-google.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2941 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/02/i-love-google.gif?resize=197%2C160&quot; alt=&quot;i-love-google&quot; width=&quot;197&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
  How do I love thee? Let me count the ways:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Through your wonderful email service, Gmail, though I’m usually accessing it through Apple Mail. When I do use my computer to access your email service, I find it so clean and streamlined and easy to follow a conversation. How did I ever use someone else? Why would I ever leave?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By using your search engine, which knows me so well. How many Wikipedia entries have you led me to? How many research projects have you made infinitely easier? How many times have you saved me in a conversation when I need a quick reminder? How many arguments have you ended among my friends? Clearly, this is your best venture by far.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Through Google Translate, which has saved my ignorance many times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In your Maps function, where you can’t get my home address right but you can always tell me how to plan road trips to faraway locations. Thank you for taking traffic into perspective, giving an actual perspective of how long it will take me to get somewhere. You’ve also taken notice of the PVTA bus schedule, which makes planning my Five-College adventures easier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By checking out your adorable doodles, which almost hides the fact that you’re an enormous corporation using my data for unknown purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In using Chrome, which is by far the best browser (even though I use Safari because of its convenience on my iPhone.) Chrome is beautiful. It’s simple. It comes with a bunch of extensions that make it great.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By creating the Chromebook, which I don’t actually use, but is beautiful and wonderful and if I ever went back from Mac, I would take you on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
  Ah, but Google, there are also some things you need to work on if we want this relationship to work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/02/google-hate-300x219.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-2939 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/files/2015/02/google-hate-300x219-300x219.jpg?resize=232%2C169&quot; alt=&quot;google-hate-300x219&quot; width=&quot;232&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes you’re like that friend that’s awesome to hang out with because you have connections and everything, but I don’t want to tell you _everything _because you’re not very good at keeping secrets. I know about your obsessive needs for surveillance. All your web-crawling and data mining efforts follow me around the Internet. I know the data that you have on me – it’s not incriminating or anything, but it’s still a little creepy. But I’m worried that if you don’t stop taking in data, it’s going to end badly for the both of us.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I know you’re not always loyal. I know about the others – and by others, I obviously mean the media conglomerates. I see it when you’re misrepresenting my search results. I see the targeted advertising on the side. We can manage, but you’re going to have to cut back on seeing them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your Books feature is failing as a library. Yes, there are concerns about your copyrights issues and digital issues, but your focus on being a search engine and your lack of concern for metadata makes it difficult for Google Books to function as a research repository. It makes me so angry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating and saving files in Docs and Drive (respectively) isn’t actually that good or useful. I mean, it’s convenient for classwork occasionally, but the application needs work if you want it to be functional. It’s actually a pain to use sometimes, and it’s difficult to organize my files the way I want to. I’m still sticking with Microsoft on this one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google News. I’ve tried to use this service a few times, but it’s never really worked for me. You can find a number of articles, but maybe I’m looking for something too specific.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google+. Stop trying to make Google+ happen. It’s not going to happen. Just buy out Facebook or something. Or Twitter. You can totally buy out Twitter. I’m fine with that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m really not a fan of you owning YouTube. It makes me uncomfortable, although I don’t know why. I guess YouTube is a creative field for me (as we’ll get to next week) and I’m worried that you won’t respect that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, you’re a huge part of my life. I don’t think I can ever let you go. But that doesn’t mean I trust you blindly. I understand that at the end of the day, you’re a machine. I know that your functionality, while normally clean and pure, can be disorganized in some ways. I know that your goal of leading me to an enlightened future is often muddled in capitalism. I know you’re trying not to be evil, but you’re certainly not &lt;em&gt;good. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not mine – you’re just my access point through which I interpret the Internet. You belong to something much bigger than me. And while I have to accept your faults at times, it doesn’t make me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally yours,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>To The Libraries!</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/to-the-libraries/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-15T10:01:16-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/to-the-libraries</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, I was back in a library&lt;br /&gt;
– three of them, in fact! I had almost forgotten how much I love being&lt;br /&gt;
surrounded by archival materials. I like looking at the stacks and nimbly&lt;br /&gt;
making my way through the folders to find what I’m looking for. There’s something&lt;br /&gt;
about holding important documents in my arms and the fresh smell of opening an&lt;br /&gt;
old book that pulls me in. And then, once I’m in, there’s no holding back – I’m&lt;br /&gt;
absorbed into something and somewhere and I’m absolutely thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;           I was&lt;br /&gt;
overjoyed by having the same experience three times in a week in three&lt;br /&gt;
different places. Here’s where I visited:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special&lt;br /&gt;
Collections and University Archives, W.E.B. DuBois Library, UMass Amherst:&lt;/strong&gt; So&lt;br /&gt;
close to home, but still a first for my time here at UMass. (I hope it’s not&lt;br /&gt;
the last!) For my Public History Workshop, we’ve been studying the Mill River&lt;br /&gt;
Flood of 1874. After the Williamsburg dam burst upstream, the reservoir poured&lt;br /&gt;
through several villages down to Northampton, killing 139 people and destroying&lt;br /&gt;
thousands of dollars worth of property. While our class has walked portions of&lt;br /&gt;
the river, it’s a bit difficult to see it in full form with all the snow we’ve&lt;br /&gt;
been having. Instead, we wanted to have a visual representation of the river&lt;br /&gt;
and the old dam. We looked through several atlases and maps, as well as&lt;br /&gt;
stereoscopic cards showcasing the damage of the flood. My professor also showed&lt;br /&gt;
us how to access the Map Collection at DuBois Library, and the especially&lt;br /&gt;
useful Digital Sanborn Maps for the area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archives&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; Special Collections, Robert Frost Library, Amherst College:&lt;/strong&gt; For my&lt;br /&gt;
class focused on using Adobe InDesign to create a book catalog, we went to&lt;br /&gt;
Amherst to investigate the history of the book. While our focus in the class is&lt;br /&gt;
primarily on their digital counterpart (the e-book), we wanted to see the&lt;br /&gt;
history of printing, the physical structure of a book, and talk about how print&lt;br /&gt;
spread. The Head of Archives &amp;amp; Special Collections, Mike Kelly, gave our&lt;br /&gt;
class a great presentation, with everything a leaf of the Gutenberg Bible to&lt;br /&gt;
the unbound Pickwick Papers to “Whiteness” that only showed up under black&lt;br /&gt;
light. For a person who basically lives in books (you should see my bedroom at&lt;br /&gt;
home!), most of my modern editions look the same. It was awesome to see books&lt;br /&gt;
of different shapes, sizes, and purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;
Room for Local History, Forbes Library, Northampton MA:&lt;/strong&gt; This was a library&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve never been to before, but one I definitely have to go back to. It’s the&lt;br /&gt;
only public library in the United States that is also a presidential library –&lt;br /&gt;
Calvin Coolidge’s to be exact. But I wasn’t there to see the former POTUS’s&lt;br /&gt;
documents (not this time, anyway.) This was another trip focused on the Mill&lt;br /&gt;
River. In addition to looking at some awesome maps of Northampton and the&lt;br /&gt;
changes to the Mill River’s route over time, I got to read articles of the&lt;br /&gt;
Hampshire Gazette and journals of Sylvester Judd. Judd was a Unitarian Minister&lt;br /&gt;
and novelist, but he spent his early life in Westhampton. He kept detailed&lt;br /&gt;
notebooks describing the area of Hadley and discussing daily life, especially&lt;br /&gt;
noting the regular floods of the river. His journals were surprisingly easy to read and packed with information. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll be in and out of these places throughout the rest of the semester, but this week was pretty fantastic! &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>McLuhan and the Message of Transmedia Adaptations</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/english-302/mcluhan-and-the-message-of-transmedia-adaptations-2/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-03T20:55:34-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/undergraduate/english-302/mcluhan-and-the-message-of-transmedia-adaptations-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/mcluhan2.jpg?resize=200%2C240&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marshall McLuhan’s writing in _Understanding Media _came off extremely dense and complex for me to comprehend, other than the obvious: “the medium is the message.” I mean, I understood that it was revolutionary, but I couldn’t quite grasp what McLuhan was getting at. But then, I though about mediums that I use and what messages they might be trying to convey. And then it clicked: as someone who has followed several transmedia productions, McLuhan’s concepts seemed all the more pressing. Which makes me wonder: what would McLuhan think of our media (and the way we understand it) today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!--YouTube Error: bad URL entered--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, what would McLuhan think of Pemberley Digital’s &lt;em&gt;The Lizzie Bennet Diaries&lt;/em&gt; (hereafter referred to as &lt;em&gt;LBD&lt;/em&gt;), which portrayed Jane Austen’s Elizabeth Bennet as a 21st-century grad student moving back home to figure out her future? Instead of just the printed word, &lt;em&gt;LBD&lt;/em&gt; used a number of mediums and accounts to tell the story – namely Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube. Viewers could pick and choose which mediums to follow the narrative on (though YouTube was the most popular choice.) To interact with the story, viewers could migrate from platform or medium, from character to character. &lt;em&gt;LBD&lt;/em&gt; is not the only transmedia production entertaining the idea of an immersive and interactive experience for an audience (literary vlogseries are all the rage now) but it was the first to attract attention for doing so. (It won an Emmy in 2013 for “Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Media-Original Interactive Program.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether intended by the creators or not, McLuhan’s idea of “the medium is the message” here is central to the experience of watching &lt;em&gt;LBD&lt;/em&gt;. Viewers were encouraged to interact with the characters as people, to be a part of this fictional world turned reality. The transmedia production requires an investment on the viewer’s part to stay involved, making the fictional a part of their everyday life. And by using these mediums – platforms designed for personal use – fans could connect with the characters in a way I believe  McLuhan would probably find fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his 1977 lecture for the Monday Conference that we watched for class, McLuhan talked about the hologram being the ultimate medium, because it would envelop the viewer’s physical presence. But McLuhan lived and studied an age before the advent of new media; his world didn’t have the smartphone or the apps we use on a daily (or if you’re like me, hourly) basis. While a hologram consumes the physical environment, transmedia productions manipulate and dominate the digital one. Lizzie’s Twitter feed reads much like our own, and so we experience her story in a similar way. Her Tumblr reblogged and shared posts from other users. Her YouTube videos broke the fourth wall because there isn’t a fourth wall anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a whole new media landscape we’re inhabiting here – and transmedia productions take advantage of that to play out these literary classics. McLuhan would be thrilled to see how pervasive today’s mediums are with their messages. But perhaps it’s this layering effect will display the greatest medium message of all. The more we interact with new media, the more the lines between reality and fiction become blurry.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2015: A Year in Resolutions</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/2015-a-year-in-resolutions/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-04T10:01:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/2015-a-year-in-resolutions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love the concept of New Years’ resolutions. I like using the beginning of anything – years, semesters, weeks – as a chance to review what I’ve accomplished and what I want going forward. Here’s what I’m hoping to do in 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Choose a topic for my honors thesis, which I’ll be starting in the fall. Take more awesome classes for my majors and minor. Learn cool stuff. Write a lot of papers. Read a lot of articles. Get good grades. Repeat.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Humanities:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Attend a 5CollDH Speaker Series (because I couldn’t this semester.) Discover more awesome DH projects. Finish my own. Start another one. Meet more DH enthusiasts. Pick up more skills and explore using tools. Read more into the debates of new media. Push for more undergraduate DH education.  Educate myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Museums:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Finish visiting the Museums10 in Western MA. Go to small, weird museums. Go to large, famous ones. Check out online exhibitions and digital museums, and experience the interactive options these places have to offer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit a Presidential Library:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Somewhat random, but I’ve visited two so far (George W. Bush’s library in Dallas and Bill Clinton’s library in Little Rock), one each year for the past two years, so I might as well keep the streak going.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Read the stack of history books by my bedside at home about the height of a nightstand. Read the bookshelf of non-history books that is overflowing onto the floor. Read the bookshelf dedicated to fiction. Read the list of books I would like to reread. That should keep me busy in my spare time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adventures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: In addition to visiting museums and libraries, I hope to go on some sort of exciting non-history related adventures as well. Go to events. Go on vacation. Visit new places. Revisit old places. Take lots of pictures and document the journey.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Keep it going. Use Twitter to learn more about what’s going on in the world. Use Tumblr to share what I learn. But also spend less time on it? I am obsessed with the world of the Internet, and I should probably take a step back every once in awhile. Or, you know, everyday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Keep watching YouTube. Watch Ken Burns’ documentaries (like all of them). Watch history shows like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;TURN&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sons of Liberty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Watch movies like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;In The Heart of the Sea.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;Finally watch &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lincoln&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Watch all those Netflix movies in queue instead of rewatching HIMYM to find out where it all went wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public History:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Read about it. Talk about it. Write about it. Follow it. Engage in it. Participate in it. Look into local projects. Look into digital projects. Look into the work in the UMass department. Basically, work hard to make myself an expert on the subject.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Events:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Try and see &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;on Broadway. Attend conferences? Go to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Towns&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;early release. Go to shows. Go to openings. Go to events.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Write short papers. Write long papers. Write articles. Write blog posts. Write to be published. Write for fun. Write. Write. Write. Write. Write. Write.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friends and Family:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Spend time with them. Make time for them. Keep in touch with home as often as possible. Check in on my siblings. Check in on my friends. Comfort friends and family. Support them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me, Myself, and I:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;As always,New Years’ is a time to focus on one’s health and overall well-being. So: Schedule workouts. Go to the gym. Eat well. Eat clean. Take care of myself. Work hard without overworking. Meditate. Alleviate stress. Be happy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;As always, I’ll be thinking about my career. Complete an internship. Start another one. Investigate summer opportunities. Have a great summer doing something I love. Look into grad school programs. Apply to grad school? Keep moving forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Of course, no matter what I do this year, I plan to keep blogging about my experiences or what I’m learning or whatever happens to be on my mind. Blogging is self-indulgent, but I love it. In the past year, I’ve discovered so many new historical tidbits as well as how to I’m not quite sure what 2015 will bring, but I know that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;She Is Historic&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;will be a part of it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>2014: A Year in Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/2014-a-year-in-review/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-28T10:01:12-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/2014-a-year-in-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seeing as 2014 was a big plot-development year in my life (and this blog’s first full year of activity,) I wanted to spend this last Sunday summarizing exactly what I did this year.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My sister and &lt;strong&gt;I obsessed over John Adams&lt;/strong&gt; for basically a whole year. We watched the HBO miniseries last Christmas break, and my timing was perfect – she was studying the Founding Fathers in APUSH. Our love of the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; POTUS made for some exciting moments for the year: watching the movie and a performance of &lt;em&gt;1776,&lt;/em&gt; trading the McCullough biography back and forth, and an &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/95415134932/my-sister-cousin-and-i-visited-the-adams&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adventure to the great man’s homestead&lt;/a&gt; in Quincy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Twitter became public&lt;/strong&gt; in order to share my adventures in research, and it led to be retweeted by some awesome people and places – including the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/79602120671/so-excited-see-the-fifth-link-thats-me-the&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution Archives!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I love Twitter for its accessibility for interactions with historians, academics and alt-ac communities, and overall cool people. Follow me &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/sheishistoric&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; for more immediate &amp;amp; personal updates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;started &amp;amp; completed several internships&lt;/strong&gt;, learning a lot about where history/public history is going. My hope to specialize my interests might have failed, but I am grateful for the people who have offered me the opportunity to participate in amazing projects. Not only have I learned about the complicated process of research, but I’ve learned a lot of tricks to do it myself. Read for the specifics &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/84017941251/the-last-lecture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/95819731502/summer-in-the-library&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I watched &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of YouTube&lt;/strong&gt; this year, including: &lt;em&gt;Vlogbrothers, Emma Approved, Carmilla, Brain Scoop, New Adventures of Peter &amp;amp; Wendy, Frankenstein MD,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Art Assignment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PBS Idea Channel&lt;/em&gt;. I love this new(ish) trend of transmedia adaptations of novels, as well as the opportunity to get behind-the-scenes in the museum world. I’m sure my fascination with vloggers will continue – can’t wait to see what’s next from the YouTube community!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/93013834077/portland-with-pictures&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;played a game with Will Shortz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at NPLCon. This is totally irrelevant to my blog, but it was so much fun that I had to include it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went to two conferences:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/87488780097/thatcampne-2014&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;THATCampNE&lt;/a&gt; and UMass GHA. I felt these two were a great way to dive into conference-going: I learned a lot from the presenters and from the overall experience. This time I was just a visitor – maybe next year I’ll be presenting at one?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/90373120057/visited-the-morgan-at-the-new-bedford-state-pier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I obsessed over a beautiful whaling vessel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Many an afternoon was spent researching the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/90180268567/cwm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Charles W. Morgan&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the oldest whaling ship in the world, and its 38&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; voyage around New England. It’s still very close to my heart (as noted by my Mac’s desktop background.)  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I discovered and declared a second major: &lt;strong&gt;Digital Humanities&lt;/strong&gt;. (If you don’t know what DH is, try this website for a good definition.) I’m really excited about this new academic path to add onto my love of history, and so far it’s taken me to exciting places. Keep an eye out for what I’m doing in that realm next year – should be some exciting stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/100414610262/visit-to-umca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/99951131517/while-home-for-columbus-day-weekend-i-made-sure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/99252498832/i-love-when-i-have-pictures-to-include-this&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/86731409837/today-i-visited-the-annual-memorial-day-weekend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/95661609112/went-to-revolutionary-war-weekend-at-fort&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; of museums and historic sites&lt;/strong&gt; (mostly in MA and RI) – I only wish I had the time/money to go exploring more often! One notable visit included that to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/86350797112/the-open-rehearsal-performance-experience&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; where I performed in the Great Gallery. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I spent some quality time at UMass Amherst (as is expected when you attend said school) and within the Five College Consortium. As usual, my classes expanded my perspective and taught me countless pieces of knowledge to carry on. I also met some great mentors and had fascinating conversation with a number of professors about classwork and ideas moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Here’s to celebrating the year that was 2014, and I hope all my readers will continue to follow me in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hometown Memories</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/hometown-memories/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-14T10:01:08-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/hometown-memories</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I’m wrapping up my posts for 2014, I’ve looked through my saved drafts for inspiration. A lot of these posts are one or two sentences along, waiting for a time when news is slow and I can really devote some time to their topic. And while I haven’t had a slow week, I think it’s time to tell this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfather grew up in Bristol, Rhode Island, a small but historically significant city in the smallest state of the US. In the many times I spent with him, he would recount the stories of his childhood, exploring what he considered the greatest place in the world. He talked about something magical in small towns, something wondrous and exciting in the endless opportunities they presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Saturday afternoon earlier this year, he and I drove around his former stomping grounds. As he sat in the navigator’s seat, he reminisced about childhood homes and hangout spots, sharing all of his memories with me. It wasn’t rare for my grandfather to share stories about his life – as a former teacher, he was a great storyteller – but it was really something special to see the town through his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we had a purpose for being in Bristol that day. You see, Bristol was home to the DeWolff-Colts, the blended family of the wealthy slave-trading DeWolff family of Bristol and the Colt family, known for the invention of the rifle. (In actuality it was Samuel Colt’s nephew who came to Bristol.) The blended family had an enormous impact on Bristol’s economy and government, and owned an enormous estate on the edge of town. In Samuel P. Colt’s will, the family estate was ordered to be open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family estate became what is known today as Colt State Park. My grandfather had spent many an afternoon there, noting one area of the park in particular. Along the bridge that once led to the Colt Mansion, many statues lined the path. But one statue had caught my grandfather’s attention – that of a dog. My grandfather’s memory of the story is that the statue was placed in honor of a real dog who had been so loyal that he would sit on the bay’s shore waiting for his owner to return from the sea. When the man died en route, the dog never wavered, starving and dying in waiting for its owner. This story of loyalty had left quite an impression on my grandfather as a young man. Unfortunately, the loyal dog statue also met a tragic end – in the late 50s, it was stolen, never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wanted to show me where the statue once was, and to do a little investigation of our own to see if we could find any more information about its origins and disappearance. Our efforts came up short that day on both accounts – but my grandfather made me promise to use my research skills to continue looking into the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still working on finding more about that dog statue, though it’s been at the back of my to-do list. But there really was something exciting about investigating the story that day. To be able to see the town through his descriptions and imagine what his life was like – that was amazing. To try and figure out the story with him and for him has been an important task – one I have to continue, if only to recreate afternoons like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Was A Teenage History Buff</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/i-was-a-teenage-history-buff/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-07T00:25:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/i-was-a-teenage-history-buff</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewpegoda.com/2014/12/03/i-am-many-things-but-a-history-buff-is-not-one-of-them-hidden-power-of-words-series-14/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Andrew Pegoda’s post&lt;/a&gt; about the difference between historians and history buffs, a point that I found really fascinating.  This is a debate that is constantly in the back of mind, because for the longest time, I didn’t really know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            My high school history courses were quite literally being taught to a test – the AP tests, to be exact – so I can’t say that I had a representative high school experience. But part of my job as a student was to memorize facts and dates and figures because those were the details I needed to pass. I loved history not just because I loved memorizing those things, but because I like the larger narratives to which they were attached. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            I definitely considered myself a history buff, because that was all I had to go off of. And being a history buff (at least in my family) was celebrated and even encouraged. As a group of trivia enthusiasts, my siblings and I wanted to find out these fun facts in order to increase our knowledge. I voraciously read everything I could get my hands on (you should check out my #shelfies) and brought myself to lectures to learn more. I wore “buff” as a badge of honor, because I assumed that to be a historian required you to be a history buff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know the difference. (For starters, historians have a lot more work to do, if my assignments this semester have been any indication.) But I still love hanging out with the history buffs. They’re the people who keep me grounded. Especially on Tumblr, they’re the ones who remind me of how much fun the people and groups I study are. They remind me to enjoy what I’m doing, that memorizing those dates and random details about people was part of what got me here and what made me want to study my field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            Obviously, I’m not quite a historian yet – I’m in that transformation phase that Andrew talks about in his post. I’m learning to process that “raw” data and make something of it.  While I’m still a master at trivia and somewhat of a history buff,  I’m invested in learning more. I’m invested in discovering how historians research and make arguments based on their findings. I’m invested in analyzing how we talk about historic events and the collective remembrance in our presentations. I like finding these stories and weaving them together to tell greater ones about who we are and how we’ve developed. I want to learn how to be a historian, because that’s what I’ve loved about history since as far back as I remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s kinda what this blog is about – the process of me learning how to become a historian: all the twists and turns that come with it, rough edges and all. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Visual Culture of Print: Trip to Mead Art Museum</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/visual-culture-of-print-trip-to-mead-art-museum/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-23T23:07:40-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/visual-culture-of-print-trip-to-mead-art-museum</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, my Hampshire College course took a trip to the Mead Art Museum at Amherst College!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course I’m taking, HACU 233, is called “Media Overload: Digital-Age Reflections on the Explosion of Print.” Our main focus has been analyzing the fears of print culture and the act of writing through 17&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century British authors and poets, juxtaposed with today’s hyperawareness of social media culture. Our adventure at the Mead looked into the visual culture of print – how is the act of reading and creating text presented in artwork?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After wandering around the Amherst College campus, for awhile, I made my way to the museum’s entrance. It’s kind of tucked away towards the back of the campus – but the building is marked by the Stearns Steeple, a vestige of the campus’s original chapel. Upon arrival, Amy Halliday, the Acting Curator of Academic Programs started off our visit by giving the class a quick tour of the museum. I didn’t get to spend much time outside of the study room, but I did get to hear some of the major events in the museum’s history – its establishment, the major donations, and the curating of some of the current exhibits on display. The inside of the museum is absolutely gorgeous – I will definitely have to revisit it by the end of the semester. After the majority of the class arrived, we moved into the study room to view our paintings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gave us a quick rundown of the rules of a study room – things I’ve become well-accustomed to, working in a library – and started us off We specifically looked at the six pictures William Hogarth’s &lt;em&gt;Marriage A-la Mode.&lt;/em&gt; As a whole, the work depicts the ill-suited marriage of the son of a earl and the daughter of a merchant. A satire of arranged marriages, Hogarth tells a tale of deceit and adultery, primarily through the use of paper – the marriage contract, the unpaid bills, the receipt, and several others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; After analyzing these paintings, we looked at several other works depicting readers. We talked about the activeness and the passiveness of reading, the gender depictions, and reflections of reading in ourselves. Following up on our class discussions, we were able to talk about how the artists felt about reading and writing and text in general. It was actually really fascinating – as most of the artwork were more modern than the ones we dealt with in class, it was neat to see that the ideas are constantly present in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to follow up this visit with one to the Frost Library Special Collections. My professor provided a list of objects that would also supplement the idea of print and visual culture, and I’m always up for a visit to a library.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Website Review: A Look at the National Women&#8217;s History Museum</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/website-review-a-look-at-the-national-womens/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-16T00:14:50-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/website-review-a-look-at-the-national-womens</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been looking into a lot of digital history exhibits – for business and pleasure – but along the way, I took a look at the National Women’s History Museum (NWMH).  Check it out at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nwhm.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.nwhm.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been following the NWHM on and off this past year, mostly through Facebook updates and Twitter from others. Reading about the establishment of a women’s history sounded awesome – but knowing that ground wasn’t breaking on the Mall, I couldn’t quite comprehend what sort of newsworthy information was being passed around. It wasn’t until this semester that I really started looking into what was actually going here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NWHM is still under construction – to be fair, it hasn’t even reached construction yet. Right now, the website is its primary source of attention, and they have done an awesome job on it. The first thing you see is the photo slider, filled with quotes from famous American women and pictures of Congress in action. Just below it, plastered everywhere are links to their social media, trying to show off new events in their progress.  It’s quite a crowded first impression to make, but it says something – excitement, energy, and seeking support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another exciting feature of the website is their legislation center. Right from the museum’s website, you can contact your senator or representative for their support in establishing the museum. (I did so – one of my senators, Elizabeth Warren, is a actually a cosponsor on the bill and responded to me with a very nice email.) The National Women’s History Museum Commission Act (S. 398) established a commission to study the possibility of putting the NWHM in a space on the National Mall or in the Washington, D.C. area. The bill passed through the House of Representatives back in May, so here’s to the Senate’s help as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NWHM also has a great collection of lessons plans and exhibits for a number of women’s history topics. Looking for a walking tour of historic sites related to the cause in your area? You can find it under “Activities.” Want to see the Lecture Series NWHM hosted at the Wilson Center? It’s right under “Videos.” Want a biography of women explorers and adventures? It’s all available for your perusal. A wealth of knowledge is at any viewer’s disposal – super cool for everyone, historians and students alike. It’s more than some other museum websites offer, and it really shows much effort has already gone into research and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of the NWHM is that it’s still in this building phase. It’s hard to find “big” museums making their way into existence in this way, and NWHM is truly making their visitors a part of that experience. NWHM is engaging people across the web – I can’t wait to see what they do in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Recap of #AskAnArchivist</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/recap-of-askanarchivist/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-02T10:36:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/recap-of-askanarchivist</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thursday was #AskAnArchivist on Twitter, so I took advantage of the opportunity to get in contact with archivists across the nation.  Here are some of the questions I asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/USNatArchives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U.S. National Archives&lt;/a&gt;: How do you explain your job to kids?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“People in our govt make lots of photos, videos, maps, paper. We get that stuff ready for you to come see it.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/LBJLibrary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LBJLibrary&lt;/a&gt;: What’s your go-to fact about LBJ to bring up at parties?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Great question. My fave #LBJ story is him driving his #amphicar into the Pedernales River pretending that the brakes failed.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“But #LBJ and #golf (cheating, telling people to let him win, etc.) is close second: &lt;a href=&quot;http://lbjlibrary.tumblr.com/post/24952903516/one-sunday-in-early-1964-lbj-invites-aide-larry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read the story here.&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the funniest moment you’ve ever had at your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Funny and not but I processed 105 folders and miss-numbered them throwing the whole series off. Funny now, but not then.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/hipster818&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erik Bauer&lt;/a&gt;, Archivst and Museum Professional for the Peabody Institute Library&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Finding cherubs of high resemblance to Bobby Hill in the margins of medieval texts.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/freifraufitz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;L. Kelly Fitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“We once found pigeons hanging out among a senator’s papers! #GradSchoolDidn’tPrepareMeForThat. We shooed away the pigeons and rehoused the records. No harm, no fowl.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/SenateHistory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U.S. Senate History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the hardest part of your job on a day-to-day basis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“As a reference archivist,  find making time for focused, large-scale projects hardest; user access &amp;amp; Q’s always come first.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/MHS1791&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MA Historical Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Not having 28 hours in a day. So many things I want/need to do &amp;amp; not enough time.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/HiramCLibrary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hiram College Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Balancing time btwn the day-to-day and big, long-term projects. Preservation means planning!” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/RoperCenter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Roper Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Responding to people who say, I didn’t know we have an archives! Staying relevant, and electronic records” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/jennyj1j&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jenny Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, a corporate archivist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Hard to quantify that. The general lack of funds/support for cultural heritage instns. is depressing tho.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/msjonesking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Morgan Jones-King&lt;/a&gt; at SCArhives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Kicking out an enthusiastic researcher when we close at 5pm is no fun!” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/ALA_Archives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Library Association Archives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Lack of support form the org/institution can be hard. Sometimes feel like you’re fighting a losing battle.” – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/CarolineRose85&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caroline&lt;/a&gt;, a UK Archivist&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Living New Deal</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/living-new-deal/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-26T10:01:15-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/living-new-deal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So for HIST 397Z, we had to make a digital history contribution in one of three ways: 1) by investigating a building or memorial for &lt;strong&gt;Lost UMass&lt;/strong&gt;; 2) contribute to &lt;strong&gt;Living New Deal&lt;/strong&gt; by updating or creating a new entry; or 3) create a &lt;strong&gt;Document Deep Dive&lt;/strong&gt; with a primary source found in the Five College archives. I chose the middle one, hoping to make an adventure out of finding one of these locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living New Deal&lt;/strong&gt; is a project hosted by the Department of Geography at the University of California, Berkley. The New Deal was a massive collection of federally sponsored projects that helped restore the American economy during the Great Depression. It supported numerous public works across the nation, like industrial infrastructure, murals and artwork, gardens, schools, and thousands of other projects. The &lt;strong&gt;Living New Deal&lt;/strong&gt;’s goal is to build a national database of these public works, recognizing preserving their presence for generations to come. Check out the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://livingnewdeal.berkeley.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Living New Deal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to see if there’s anything in your area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was home for the long weekend, I tried to find a site for the project that was close by. Looking over the map, I realized there weren’t a lot in my area. This was sort of a surprise, as I knew my old high school was partially built as part of WPA project. (I didn’t use my high school for my contribution, though, as it’s in the process of being torn down.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with my research interests in New Bedford, I started reading into projects in and around the city. What I found was really fascinating – New Bedford was a city filled with WPA (Works Progress Administration) projects. Already on the fringes of economic recession due to the decline of whaling, the Great Depression severely affected New Bedford. At its peak in 1939, twenty-nine percent of its labor force was unemployed. The city’s mayor, Charles S. Ashley, used federal funds from the WPA to establish a number of city emergency work projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I came to find out, New Bedford is actually a fascinating case of the WPA in action of a local level. Read this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20140928/NEWS/140929938/-1/NEWSMAP&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=HAenfiGZxGcC&amp;amp;pg=PA266&amp;amp;dq=new+bedford+wpa&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=IGdEVMnqEK3fsATGzIG4CA&amp;amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this chapter&lt;/a&gt; from Christine’s _Writers, Plumbers, and Anarchists: The WPA Writers’ Project in Massachusetts _to know more – but the summary of it was that while the WPA provided funds for dozens of projects that helped city maintenance, actually joining the WPA was seen as a social stigma to most New Bedford citizens. I’d love to spend more time researching this social reaction &amp;amp; contributing to the &lt;strong&gt;Living New Deal&lt;/strong&gt; with New Bedford projects – maybe I can get around to it over winter break?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project I decided to focus on was the New Bedford Regional Airport. (It’s also called the Municipal Airport – I’m not sure which one is correct.)  Initially proposed for recreational use, the airfield was built between 1940 and 1942. At the time of its dedication, it was consisted of two 3,500-foot runways, with minimal lighting. Less than a year later, the airport was turned over the U.S. Government for World War II. Both the Army Air Corps and U.S. Navy used the space, expanding the airfield into a full-fledged airport. After the war, the space was returned to the city of New Bedford, which uses the airport as a regional passenger hub &amp;amp; for flight school operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the site, visited its observation deck, and took a few pictures to add to my report. I’ve submitted this site to the &lt;strong&gt;Living New Deal&lt;/strong&gt; about a week ago, so my part of the project is over. I’m not sure how long it takes for submissions to be posted, but I hope it’s soon!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Visit to UMCA</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/visit-to-umca/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-19T11:46:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/visit-to-umca</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So on Friday afternoon, my friend and I made our way over to the University Museum of Contemporary Art (UMCA) here at UMass. It’s been on our to-do lists for awhile, and so when the opportunity arose after lunch, we made our way over to the Fine Arts Center (FAC) to stop in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its brochure, UMCA is the “only university-affiliated public art museum in Western Massachusetts devoted to national and international contemporary art.” The museum is REALLY small, especially in context with the size of the FAC’s building. It also appeared really empty on the inside – I’m not sure if that’s because the museum has limited collections on display, or if it simply doesn’t have the space for large collections, but it was a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UMCA currently has two in-house exhibits: Walid Raad’s “Postface,” and specially-curated “The Art of Collecting.” Both of these exhibits are only here for the rest of the semester (in case you were thinking about visiting.) Both exhibits were fascinating – “Postface” combined ideas of Islamic art with  an exploration of tradition and the disaster; “The Art of Collecting” was a display of innovation in printing from donations by Risa Gerrig (a UMass alumna.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my friend and I walked around the exhibits, we started talking about how art – especially contemporary art – is hard to decipher. It’s a curator’s job to create a narrative and to help visitors experience pieces of work – but it’s a visitor’s job to continue building off of those ideas to make their own interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we took it upon ourselves to do just that, in the form of discussion. Instead of reading the placards first, we made our way through the two exhibits by making up our own critiques of the artwork. What did we get out the painting? What did the color changes in the video portion of Raad’s display mean? What emotions did the work evoke? What did we like about it? What didn’t we like? After generating a few comments, we’d read the placard and continue our conversation from there. We worked our way around the rooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, our two minutes or so with each work were so much more fascinating than if we hadn’t done so. Being the only visitors to the museum, we were free to talk out loud and have a quality conversation about what we were looking at. It made the artwork and the experience personal – and it was fun to imagine wacky and fantastical explanations for what was going in the piece. But it also helped me develop some quality artistic critique – I started seeing what the narratives and ideas presented in the exhibits were getting at. It made me feel inspired, it kept my attention, and it was exciting. It really &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; the experience for me. By the end of the visit, I no longer felt that I was intruding by misinterpreting the work presented. My friend and I had created an exhibit all our own. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>While Home For Columbus Day Weekend I Made Sure</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While home for &lt;strike&gt;Columbus Day &lt;/strike&gt;Weekend&lt;strike&gt;,&lt;/strike&gt; I made sure to visit a museum! These photos are from the Roger Williams Park Museum of Natural History. It’s been several years since my last visit, and I only vaguely remembered its exhibits – the planetarium being the most memorable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Museum currently has four major exhibits: Africa, Circle of the Sea, Dynamic Galaxies, and Natural Selections (an explanation of the origins of the natural history museum &amp;amp; the museum movement.) My favorite part however, was their newest exhibit, “Treasures from the Attic.” (Unfortunately, no pictures from there – it’s a bit difficult to take an unblurry picture of a letter.) Like most museums, less than 2% of the RWP Museum’s holdings are on display for the public. In order to show some of their Park-specific items, this exhibits displays letters and items relevant to the history of the institution. Letters about prospective animals for the Zoo, item collecting, and famous people of Providence are placed in display cases throughout the foyer. I thought it was a great introduction to the purpose of the museum, as well as a nice summary of what else the Museum attempts to teach its visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to check out the installment of their next exhibit, “Seismic Shifts,” in late November!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Love When I Have Pictures To Include This</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/i-love-when-i-have-pictures-to-include-this/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(I love when I have pictures to include!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past Friday, I spent my morning at Historic Deerfield! I’ve been told that this was a must-see for over a year now. After given the chance to use my visit as extra credit for HIST 397Z, I made sure to put aside some time to visit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know exactly what to see there, so I started wandering along the one-mile street, admiring the buildings and attempting to get a sense of what it felt like. My favorite part of Historic Deerfield was the fact that it was an open-air living history museum. It serves an actual neighborhood and school community, and the museum buildings just happen to be around there as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting my admission ticket, I first visited the Stebbins house, a home built in 1799 which represents Federal period architecture. It was also the first brick home in Deerfield. Asa Stebbins, the home’s original owner, was a fairly influential man – in addition to being a wealthy farmer and mill owner, he served on building committees of two other brick buildings in the area. If you visit, be sure to check out the Captain Cook wallpaper in the main entryway – very cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I went to the Wapping Schoolhouse, which was a traditional one-room schoolhouse. Wapping served as the district schoolhouse, which meant all the families within a 2-mile radius would support this building. The volunteer here (whose name has slipped my mind) was extremely friendly, explaining how long the building had been there, how else it had been used, and even how such a schoolroom functioned. I even got to try my hand at using a slate board (much easier than chalk) and ink and quill (I wasn’t very good at it.) Hands-on interaction is always the best!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took the time to see the Sheldon House, which was built in 1754/7 but interprets the story during the period of 1780 to 1810. During those thirty years, three generations of the Sheldon family occupied the house. They were were a farm family, so I followed up my tour of the home by spending the  last few minutes walking along the Charming Footpath, which goes by an active dairy farm while explaining the agriculture of Deerfield. Not only did I get to see some animals (pigs and cows, primarily), but the footpath lived up to its name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also loved talking to the volunteers at Deerfield. After working beside many volunteers at NBWM this summer, I know that the people who spend their time working for historic organizations are some of the most knowledgeable people to speak with. I had so many questions and they were happy to answer, even giving me more information than I needed. Volunteers are supposed to help contribute to the great experience museums offer, and these men and women certainly took their job seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Historic Deerfield doesn’t allow photographs within buildings (something that I completely understand but have always been bothered about while in museums.) However, it wasn’t the inside of the buildings that I wanted to capture the feeling of – it was that one-mile street I kept coming back to. It reminded me of walking tours in historic districts, except better. It had the Western Mass vibe of quiet repose alongside the weight of historic importance I seek to find everywhere. By being an open-air space, I truly got the feeling of living history – that this space is still used and important to the community that uses it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even get to see half of the stuff Historic Deerfield has to see, so I will definitely go back at some point (maybe even later this semester.) But it’s beautiful and wonderful, and I’m so glad I finally took some time to go.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Public History: My Experience With Numen</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/public-history-my-experience-with-numen/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-28T10:01:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/public-history-my-experience-with-numen</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So in my public history a few weeks back, we were discussing how we as students have interacted with public history. The professor encouraged us to share our own experiences with museums – something fun, something different, something that made history come alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of memories that I could share about museums – I mean, I’ve been on plenty of family vacations and adventures of my own where I’ve been surprised or excited or learned something new at a museum. But there is one moment in particular that I remembered as &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; than the others – and though I didn’t share it in class, I’d like to share it here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was fifteen, I joined a local school’s trip to London, which at the time was my absolute dream vacation. I had always loved Harry Potter and so I saw England and the United Kingdom as this fantastically posh place where all excitement seemed to happen. I read the itinerary nightly in the months leading up to the trip, finding all of the exciting places I would go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, i wasn’t totally sure that I wanted to go into history – I just knew it was something I liked, something I was interested in. And so, a place like the British Museum seemed really cool on paper – and I was excited to go. But walking into the museum was something else – for lack of better words, it took my breath away. Someone pointed out to me that I didn’t smile the entire time I was in the museum – something I too noticed. I was so overwhelmed by sheer size of the collections, the information, and the building itself – there was so much to take in. I saw all the notable items – the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, the Assyrian Bulls – but I felt out of place. I had been to many museums before, but this was different – this was a world in which I had little context and little background that I was unsure what to make of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash forward two years later, when my family spent our Christmas vacation in London. I was a different person than the girl who had made her way to London as a sophomore – it was my senior year of high school, I’d just been accepted to UMass Amherst (literally just the day before), and I had expanded my knowledge of history to the point where I had actually decided to be a history major. I had been looking forward to returning to the place that had once mystified me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I ever stopped smiling once I entered the museum. It was truly amazing how different the building looked to me – no longer intimidating and filled with a hodgepodge of items, but fascinating and filled with knowledge I could actually comprehend. Time didn’t seem to pass  felt like an _aha! _moment – realizing how comfortable and at ease the museum made me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a common desire of people visiting museums, historic houses and sites – &lt;em&gt;numen.&lt;/em&gt; It’s a bit difficult to explain exactly what _numen _is, but it’s not far from what I described.  A “deep engagement or transcendence” a form of empathy, or an “awe of reverence” allows visitors to experience something very personal when experiencing history. And I’m searching to find that feeling in every museum I visit – greeting this realm of public history like an old friend.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Microhistory with Carlo Ginsburg</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/microhistory-with-carlo-ginsburg/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-22T17:21:32-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/microhistory-with-carlo-ginsburg</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;em&gt;Ideas That Changed History&lt;/em&gt; course, we’ve been talking a lot about the history of historians through historiography. (I used &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; way too many times in that sentence.) That is to say, we’ve read about how the discourse of history has changed over time – how interpretations and presentations have developed, what has been addressed, and what has been studied. This involves questions of method, narrative and analysis, and subjects of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we discussed some of the approaches to historiography and how to actually talk about history and  I took particular interest into was &lt;/span&gt;_microhistory. _The term seemed fairly self-explanatory, but its primary focus in on history from the bottom up. Instead of looking at the major events of a period or the major players, microhistory involves taking one moment in time or one particular person and analyzing it as much as possible in order to tell a story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get a good understanding of exactly what microhistory is, we read Carlo Ginsburg’s _The Cheese and the Worms. _The title, though a little strange, refers to a comment made by a 16th-century Italian miller during his trial as part of the Inquistion. Most of what Ginsburg could reveal about Mennochio comes directly from the trial records themselves – which appears to be extremely limiting. But Ginsburg helped the story of Mennochio apply to larger themes, such as the Inquisition, the Reformation, and the changing ideas during this time in history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ginsburg tells this microhistory as a narrative, weaving just enough information for the average reader to carry the story but making it intriguing for the historian as well. Though limited in his information, Ginsburg takes what he has and recreates a 16th-century Italian village, attempting to get through the mind of the peasant miller who stood up to the Church. While Mennochio’s story isn’t revolutionary, it still feels that way – at least, it does to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think that’s part of the cool thing about microhistory – it can truly showcase a person or an event in a person’s life that never would be considered in a survey course. I mean, isn’t that what’s exciting about history – being able to bring it alive for someone in real-time, by making these large and small connections? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all I’ve got for this week – definitely check out this great read, and keep an eye out for more on microhistory. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Back to School!</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/back-to-school/"/>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/back-to-school</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was quite a summer, but I couldn’t be happier to be back at UMass for another year! I’ve already had my first week of classes, and I’m pleased to say that it should be an interesting semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m taking two courses in the history department – 397Z, Introduction to Public History, and 394CI, Ideas That Changed History. The first course is relatively new to the course offerings – while UMass is home to the oldest public history program in the country, there isn’t a formal concentration for undergraduates. We’ll be having lots of guest speakers in class and discussing the forms by which we present history to the public. The second course is a requirement for my major that focuses on historiography. I’m really intrigued by what this course will bring, as it should prepare me for more difficult, graduate-level work. I plan to share some of my thoughts on those classes, so keep an eye out for #hist397z and #hist394ci on my posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also taking a course in Sociology on youth risk and rebellion resistance, a Journalism course in web design. In addition, I’m taking advantage of the Five College Consortium to take a course at Hampshire College – “Media Overload,” which takes a digital-age perspective at the explosion of print culture. Hampshire does teach a little differently than UMass – the courses are much more discussion-based and traditionally give evaluations instead of grades at the end of the semester. It will definitely be interesting to see how the course goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was accepted into the first stage of the UMass BDIC program, which is an individualized major program for students to take an interdisciplinary approach to their education. My plan is to form a secondary major in Digital Humanities – after my experience in a course last semester and participating in THATCampNE, I’ve decided I would really like to pursue the field in-depth. Throughout the course of this semester, I’ll be formalizing my curriculum and officially proposing the major to the department. So, keep on the lookout for DH-related posts as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck to everyone else this fall semester!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Summer In The Library</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/summer-in-the-library/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-26T08:39:58-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/summer-in-the-library</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I love about historians: they are storytellers. Whether we know it consciously or simply find our way there, we search the past for a semblance of something relatable or funny or interesting. We further our interests (or those of others) in efforts to remember something worth remembering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, archivists and librarians collect stories. They house materials in order to keep them in context, providing the information to the world, only if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could not be a better match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was extremely excited to join the New Bedford Whaling Museum as an intern this summer, I’ve grown especially fond of its history and legacy over the past year. I applied to the Archives &amp;amp; Library position as I figured in my goal of becoming a professor, I’ll have to do a lot of work with archival research. I wanted a behind-the-scenes look at things – being able to see researchers in their element while discovering just what it is they look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk was devoted to Mss (Manuscript) collections, which featured a little bit of everything in Old Dartmouth local history.Though many of these collections had been accessioned by the museum, they hadn’t been processed or given a proper finding aid so that researchers could make use of the materials. So, I took inventories, processed and organized the contents of various folders, created finding aids, and then coded the information for the Museum website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tasks, though long and sometimes difficult, it was my favorite job. It was reading moments in time, getting some pieces of evidence and having to form a coherent storyline through folders and boxes And the stories were endless. I looked at documents from the very beginnings of the Dartmouth/New Bedford area (late 17th century) to letters from the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to whaling, I learned an enormous amount. With the 38th voyage of the &lt;em&gt;Charles W. Morgan&lt;/em&gt;, this was a perfect summer to fully immerse myself in the city’s whaling history. I was able to see multiple sides of the story – whalers writing home to their wives and children explaining day-to-day activities on board; businessmen managing their vessels and crew from home; wives and children describing life in bustling communities thriving on the maritime economy. I saw its rise as an American industry, the city’s prominence as the whaling capital, and its decline (especially with the Arctic disasters of the 1870s.) Encompassing myself in this time was fascinating because there was always a new angle from which to view the industry. And just being in the research library, I was surrounded by an overwhelming amount of information that I began to understand how influential whaling truly was to the Old Dartmouth area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t all about whaling – I explored topics like Joshua Slocum’s solo circumnavigation of the globe (&lt;strong&gt;Teller Collection)&lt;/strong&gt;, the Gold Rush &lt;strong&gt;(Rounsevell Family Papers)&lt;/strong&gt;, life in Martha’s Vineyard &lt;strong&gt;(Eliza Russell Papers)&lt;/strong&gt;, beginnings of mill construction &lt;strong&gt;(Howland Family Papers)&lt;/strong&gt;, and antique dealers &lt;strong&gt;(Winfred W. Bennett Papers)&lt;/strong&gt;, just to name a few. The pacing of the job was probably my favorite aspect – I was able to study a wide range of subjects in a short period of time, without an overwhelming feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got to spend some time on the digital side of things – learning to code was surprisingly easy once I got the hang of it. (I still keep the template out just in case, though.) The most helpful tip when it comes to digital collections is management is this: &lt;strong&gt;LOCKSS&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt;ots &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;f &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;opies &lt;strong&gt;K&lt;/strong&gt;eeps &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;tuff &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;afe.) While downloading logbook files, converting file formats, and uncovering bugs in a code weren’t the most glamorous of tasks, their importance was undoubtedly valuable. I started to investigate the pressing issues of archives and libraries entering the digital world. Do GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) have the time and capabilities to digitize collections? How should these materials be uploaded?  What will happen when servers are filled to capacity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the research library is primarily for the Whaling Museum, it is also home to the collections of the Old Dartmouth Historical Society and the Melville Society. This meant people were coming to the library for tons of different reasons. While a library is not the greatest forum for interaction (my mother was shocked I could spend six hours sitting without talking to anyone), I found that everyone in the library – employees and visitors alike – was friendly and enthusiastic. (My favorite visitors, by far, were the kids from Ocean Explorium. Their confusion over the card catalog and obsession with the possible hidden money in the old bankers’ desk was very adorable.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work in the Library focused on two goals: to ease access to research and to preserve the materials. And ultimately, I found that archives intend to do just that. But more so, I learned what librarians and archivists require: a passion for information – for organizing and formatting the mess of materials that arrive, for sharing these materials with others, You are the first one to view these accessions as stories or vignettes of someone’s life, and do so without any background information at all. It’s an amazing job – one I’d love to try my hand at again someday.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my last week at the New Bedford Whaling Museum (I can’t believe how quickly that went by!) I have a much longer post planned for next week, but I thought I’d start by sharing the lighthearted pieces of advice I’ve acquired over the summer.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always wear light-colored clothes. Those new black pants might look good on you, but the dust from the collections does not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My worst nightmare: an entire folder of crosshatch writing. Even worse: people who make copies of crosshatch letters. How are you supposed to read those things?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please have neat handwriting. Your archivist will thank you greatly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When Oxygen XML editor points out an issue in the code, the solution is probably way back at the beginning of the document, and not where Oxygen thinks it is located.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kids do not necessarily understand why you can’t take books out of a research library, but they are very excited about the strangest things – for instance, the card catalog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paper clips and staples are demons of office supplies, and given time, will destroy everything in their way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are several different types of whaling vessels: ships, brigs, barks. If you don’t know the difference, always go with “boat” or “vessel.” You will never be wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is always one random paper in a collection that doesn’t seem to jibe with the rest of the materials. Just go with it – that’s what “miscellaneous” folders are for.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Six hours goes by &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; quickly, unless you’re reading business correspondence. In that case, one letter feels like eons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Finding a letter that says “please destroy this so no one can read it” is a rare joy of irony. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Portland (With Pictures!)</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/portland-with-pictures/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-27T10:33:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/portland-with-pictures</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year, my family and I went to Portland, Maine, on our summer vacation for the National Puzzlers’ League Convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother is an avid crossword puzzle solver/maker, and so he was definitely in his element at the convention, spending the majority of his time in the hospitality suite with every sort of puzzle you could imagine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/33.media.tumblr.com/1e20cb642dd293a7b202c1a4c4f1604b/tumblr_inline_n91fb31wT41r3maoq.jpg?w=700&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, on the other hand, was a bit lost. I usually struggle with a Tuesday crossword and Double Jeopardy  – never mind vowelless crosswords, cryptics, analinks, and meta puzzles. However, everyone at the convention was extremely friendly and helpful, and though it was pretty clear I was a stroller (as opposed to a runner/competitive puzzler), I had a great time attempting to solve some of these masterpieces. I’ve brought a few home, so in my spare time I’ll try to conquer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, it wouldn’t be a vacation for me if I didn’t go to a museum! While in Portland, I made sure to take in some of the city’s most interesting collections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/31.media.tumblr.com/d91a5db41d5b69d074b30910384e9d49/tumblr_inline_n91fa4mMLL1r3maoq.jpg?w=700&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptozoology Museum&lt;/strong&gt;: This is certainly one of the more unique museums I have ever been to. Cryptozoology is a pseudoscience – the study of hidden animals that have not yet been proven to exist. Yes – the majority of the creatures discussed in the museums are the stuff of legends – Bigfoot, Yeti, Loch Ness Monster, Mothman, and so on. But cryptozoology does have a point – creatures like the giant squid, mountain gorilla, and the okapi were all once considered unreal until their discovery. Loren Coleman, who seems to be the leading expert in the field, collected all of the items in the museum for display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/38.media.tumblr.com/f84b37d8ff54dbb1d46cb5daeda50c1d/tumblr_inline_n91falLupz1r3maoq.jpg?w=700&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portland Museum of Art&lt;/strong&gt;: I did this one on my own once I saw the museum had an entire floor of impressionism (my favorite!) And while the impressionist section was great, I also loved the modern art floor. I even got to see the Richard Estes’s &lt;em&gt;Realism&lt;/em&gt;, which was a special exhibit. One thing I learned was that most of the time, galleries are arranged so that all the paintings are at the same level. In &lt;em&gt;salon-_style, however, the wall will be covered with paintings at various heights, in order to present connections and stories among the art. After watching Sarah Urist Green’s “The Art Assignment,” I’ve been learning to see art with a different perspective – being able to apply it while in Portland and being able to notice _why&lt;/em&gt; curators and artists present work in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/31.media.tumblr.com/952e707cab293ada43c9983dc82e8269/tumblr_inline_n91fhaGWHt1r3maoq.jpg?w=700&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow House&lt;/strong&gt;: With my family and a very enthusiastic docent, I toured the first brick home in Portland (and the oldest structure on the Portland peninsula.) The home is almost entirely intact – thanks to Henry’s sister, Anne, she passed the home right onto the Maine Historical Society with all of the furniture and contents from the time of her death. Four generations of families lived in the home, and I highly recommend it for not only the history of the famous poet but for the history of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; architecture and home life. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An Update: What Am I Working On?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/an-update-what-am-i-working-on/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-20T20:54:49-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/an-update-what-am-i-working-on</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ack! So many new things happening (and it’s been awhile since I’ve written anything) – where should I start?&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;At the Whaling Museum, I’ve almost completed three new projects. First, I finished the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delano Family Papers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which informed me of the ancestors of FDR and their business in Fairhaven. The collection studied three generations of the family, and though a lot is well-known about the earliest (Phillipe Delanoye) and FDR’s grandfather (Warren Delano II), not much is present about the people in between. (Well, that is, until you read this collection.) Most of what I read were business dealings (the Delanos were important in the Fairhaven trading business.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about this was that someone actually came to the library to use the collection I had organized! It seemed cool that only a few weeks before, it would’ve been impossible for a researcher to do that. And as a side note: if you’re looking for broader information about the Delano family, I suggest you check out &lt;a class=&quot;tumblelog&quot; href=&quot;http://tmblr.co/m4-0xUUjBpSXb4XhLrT3u3A&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;delanopaperproject&lt;/a&gt;, a tumblr of someone researching at the FDR Presidential Library. The anecdotes of the Delano family range from funny to serious, so I’m sure you’ll find some interesting tidbits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next collection was the &lt;strong&gt;David A. Henderson&lt;/strong&gt; collection. This monstrosity of a collection was over 17 linear feet in extent – thankfully, I did not have to actually look at all those boxes. Instead, I was tasked with organizing the finding aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henderson was scholar-in-residence at the Museum from the late seventies to the early nineties, and he specialized in Pacific whaling, specifically in the Okhotsk Sea. His collection contains a little bit of everything, though. While the inventory was very well organized, it was my job to structure it into a finding aid  – easier said than done. Most of this project just involved formatting – so while it wasn’t as interesting as some of my previous work, it helped me hone the basic skills of XML and finding aid creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, I’m just finishing the Howland family papers, which details the lives of Matthew, Rachel, and Matthew Morris Howland, a prominent Quaker whaling family. The librarian had done some preliminary organizing of the collection, but for the most part, I was on my own to completely reorganize and make an inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this collection because unlike the others, almost all of the collection was made up of correspondence. The first section of the collection is devoted to Matthew’s letters to Rachel during what appears to be their courtship. It seemed strange that something such as his love letters would be such an integral part of the collection – but indeed, it is. The letters span almost two years of correspondence, discussing Matthew’s life and career as he rises through New Bedford society in contrast with the change in their relationship from platonic to romantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second subseries, Matthew to his son, Morris, focused more on the Howland business. After attending Brown University, Morris moved out to California (a move which had his father worried, for his son might succumb to the sins of the West.) From there, Morris managed the Pacific end of the whaling business. Through the letters, I learned more about the success and decline of the Howland’s business, as well as how Matthew wanted to pass on the legacy of the family name to his children. I’ll be writing a blog post on this collection for the Whaling Museum later this week, so keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what my next collection will be just yet – I still have to finish encoding the Howland collection and post it on the website – but I’m certainly enjoying this work in the archives. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;
  I could write about a lot of exciting things that have happned this week, but if you’ve been following me on Twitter, you know there’s only one thing on my mind: the &lt;em&gt;Charles W. Morgan&lt;/em&gt; is home!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;
  The &lt;em&gt;Morgan&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful whaling vessel, the last surviving wooden whaling ship from the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century American fleet. It’s also the second-oldest commercial ship, right behind the USS Constitution. During her 80-year career, the &lt;em&gt;Morgan &lt;/em&gt;made 37 voyages that brought her crew from the Arctic to Cape Horn and everything in between. This summer, the &lt;em&gt;Morgan&lt;/em&gt; is making a historic 38&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; voyage, visiting some of her former ports and some new ones to celebrate maritime history, US environmental history, and to share the story of the &lt;em&gt;Morgan &lt;/em&gt;throughout New England.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;
  So while the &lt;em&gt;Morgan &lt;/em&gt;spends her time in Mystic Seaport, Connecticut, her hometown is New Bedford, Massachusetts. Charles Wahn Morgan chose to build and launch his namesake from the Hillman Brothers’ shipyard in New Bedford. After retiring in 1921, the &lt;em&gt;Morgan &lt;/em&gt;returned to New Bedford harbor and the surrounding area. However, the city could not maintain the ship in its deteriorating condition, and agreed to sell her to Mystic. It certainly wasn’t an easy decision for the city to make, and everyone has been reminded of that with her arrival this week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;
  Of course, I was eagerly checking maritime traffic and tweeting various officials to see when the &lt;em&gt;Morgan &lt;/em&gt;was going to arrive. When all looked good for Wednesday, I joined some family friends on their boat to go out in Buzzards Bay and see her with all the sails out – something most people won’t get to see on this voyage. Seeing this beautiful ship at sea was amazing. She was surrounded by a fleet of rescue boats, police boats, and onlookers, everyone trying to get a great glimpse of a little of bit of history. After some great photo opportunities, we headed back into the harbor, and I quickly made my way to Fort Phoenix in Fairhaven to watch the &lt;em&gt;Morgan&lt;/em&gt; enter through the hurricane barrier.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;
  I don’t know how to describe the view (and unfortunately, in all the excitement my iPhone died so I couldn’t capture it.) My favorite perspective is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YTsdgZ-bow&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; video of the Fairhaven Village Militia. It was loud and exciting – all the police sirens going off, boats honking their horns, and the five cannons blasting off. But it was also really peaceful in a nostalgic sort of way. It was weird to remember that the &lt;em&gt;Morgan&lt;/em&gt; had made its way to New Bedford many times before, and yet this was probably its first time with such excitement and honor upon its arrival. It was weird to remember that New Bedford was once full of ships and brigs and barks like this one. But mostly, it was weird because I am usually alone in feeling the historic significance of moments, and yet I knew that everyone else around me had this feeling of joy and nostalgia – everyone knew this ship was coming home.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After work on Friday, I made my way over the Museum (best thing about being a member is the free admission) and quickly walked up to the observation deck. The deck has always been my favorite part of the museum. Unfortunately, the state pier building blocks a perfect view of the Morgan, but you can see some of her from the top of the museum. When looking at that harbor, you can almost imagine what the city looked like two hundred years ago. Things haven’t changed that much – there are plenty of boats in the harbor, albeit different ones; the so-called “widow’s walks” sit atop some of the houses; many of the historic buildings still sit by the water.  From that observation deck, you can look out at the harbor and see something spectacular – or maybe something that was. And that’s what’s so beautiful about seeing the &lt;em&gt;Morgan&lt;/em&gt; come to New Bedford once more: to remind us that history repeats itself in a different way. Her presence in New Bedford – and really, around any of the ports she’s visiting this summer – should remind us that our maritime past was an integral part of New England and US history. And if you take a moment to look at the big picture, you can still see how much hasn’t changed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;link_description&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;Emily Esten from UMASS Amherst is currently interning in the Museum&amp;rsquo;s Research Library. Her first project centered around Manuscript Collection #131 (Mss 131) with a complete finding aid serving as the finish product. Below are Emily&amp;rsquo;s reflections on her first completed project. &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Check out the blog post I wrote for the NBWM&amp;rsquo;s blog, with my reflections on Mss 131!

   <title>Mss 131</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/mss-131/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-22T10:01:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/mss-131</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week at the archives, I finished Mss 131!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very excited (though it’s difficult to show excitement in a library – mostly just excessive smiling and reserved self-high-fiving) and I think I had a right to be. It was really weird to realize that my work is going to be in that library until they get rid of the collection – my name is on the finding aid in the hard copy binder, it’s on the website (I tweeted about that one already), and my handwriting is on each individual folder in each of those nine boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already written a detailed blog post about working with Mss 131. However, there are a few things I didn’t include there: here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Joshua Slocum’s story is an adventurous one, and so I’m surprised I haven’t heard of it before. Some refer to his work, &lt;em&gt;Sailing Alone Around The World&lt;/em&gt;, a seafaring &lt;em&gt;Walden&lt;/em&gt;. He also disappeared while on one of his voyages, which sounds like it should be on some sort of History Channel special.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no such thing as too much research. Looking through Teller’s materials, he has everything from ship accounts to handwriting analysis on Joshua Slocum. If you’re writing, you need to be an expert – and Teller definitely was the foremost scholar of Joshua Slocum.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even when you think you’re finished, you’re probably not. There were several times throughout Mss 131 where I thought I had done everything. I wanted to impress my supervisor with my speed and quality of work. But as I would go through things, there was always one more grammatical error, one more formatting slip, one more folder out of order. It reminded me that in the archives, speed isn’t necessarily the most important thing – and that an archivist’s work is never done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I did finish! And gleaming with pride, I almost missed my supervisor take my next assignment off the shelves. My next project is Mss 134 – The Delano Family papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes – the Delanos, as in Franklin Delano Roosevelt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not exactly as in FDR. The papers are from his grandfather (Warren Delano II), his great-grandfather (Warren Delano I), and his great-great-grandfather (Ephraim Delano), as well as some other relatives. Unlike Joshua Slocum, I KNOW who the Delano Family is, as well as their relevance to the New Bedford area. The Delanos were one of the first families to come to Massachusetts (though not on the Mayflower) and purchased the Dartmouth Township from Massasoit in the early 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. They lived in the area, but the official Delano homestead standing today was built by Warren Delano II in Fairhaven during the early 1830s, and the 32&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; president and wife Eleanor made several visits to the town.  (I’ve done a lot of research on the Delano family and geneaology up to FDR, so I’m fairly confident in my ability to tell you anything about the New Bedford/Fairhaven Delanos.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My supervisor was excited to show me the collection because it was the opposite of the Teller situation. When I started working with Mss 131, I had a detailed listing but none of the folders were in order. This time around, all the folders are in order, but I’m not provided with a background of what these folders are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the person who processed this collection (Michael P. Dyer, senior maritime historian at the library) in 2007 (the year it was assessed) created something like an inventory list for me, describing contents of individual folders. What I love about this collection (aside from the fact that it’s about the Delanos) is that I’m working with primary sources – some of the documents date back to the late 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. These are the oldest documents I have ever touched before, and I am being extremely careful in my moments of excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this collection was MUCH smaller than the last (it’s only six linear inches) and I didn’t have to do all the organizing like before, I went through the process in about two days. Now, I’m working on coding the finding aid, which is much easier this time around. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I&#8217;m Getting Better With Computers</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/im-getting-better-with-computers/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-15T22:26:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/im-getting-better-with-computers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s something you may or may not know about me: &lt;em&gt;I’m not that great with computers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, sure – I’m pretty much my family’s expert in setting up your wireless printer, posting your stuff to social media, and basic Photoshop skills. I’ve been helping my mother with making her Excel spreadsheet charts for years, making Powerpoints look awesome (though my new choice of presentation is Prezi) from classes like English to Music, and serving as a social media coordinator for a few businesses and my own digital persona.&lt;!-- more --&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this has all been trial-and-error for me, and for the most part, I don’t really consider myself at an “expert” level. Most of the so-called “computer skills” I’ve acquired are simply part of being a digital native in today’s culture (which is an entirely different subject that I’m not going to get into today.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to [what I consider] the important aspects of computer – the building and creating and coding – I have absolutely no background in. It’s something I’m certainly interested in – and a digital humanist, I kinda should be – but it’s something I prefer to leave to the compsci majors and read about its effects in Doctorow books. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this week, when my supervisor at the NBWH Archives asked me if I had any experience in coding, I had to be honest – I had no idea. Up until THATCamp, I hadn’t heard of XML before – only the more commonly discussed HTML. The two look similar (at least, to my untrained eye) but serve two different purposes. In short, HTML is a way for the computer to understand what to show on the screen; XML is a way for the coder to understand the context of the information. Essentially, XML serves as the middle man between me and the computer – making sure that we both understand we’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, XML is great for archivists – archivists care about preservation of meaning. In my case, I’m using XML to display the finding aid I created for Mss 131 – without it, the importance of categories and structure (or meaning of the text) would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, my supervisor was very helpful in explaining the purpose and the practice of XML. At first glance, the coding looked strange – lots of &amp;lt;&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;/&amp;gt; across the screen. But after viewing the structure and going through the process of generating this information, I started to get the hang of how XML works. I’m about halfway through the code right now – please wish me luck! &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>THATCampNE 2014</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/thatcampne-2014/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-01T09:18:24-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/thatcampne-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So this past weekend, I attended THATCamp (The Humanities And Technology) New England at Boston University. When I signed up for THATCamp back in January, I had little to no idea what digital humanities. I had signed up for a course on it, it sounded pretty cool, and I figured by the time May 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; rolled around I would have a better idea of what this buzzword meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            Well, about the week before May 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, I realized that while I know had a better idea of what digital humanities was, I had no idea what THATCamp was going to be like. I’ve only been to one academic conference before, and that was at UMass, where I could at least pop in as a student and not feel obliged to contribute to anything. I was worried I was going to be WAY over my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            What I loved about THATCamp was the unconference style. I walked in on the first day and grabbed a blank schedule, filling it in as I listened to different proposals of topics, everything from cross-campus projects to syllabi to sustainability. There were a few things set in stone, of course – mostly workshops on various DH tools – but for the most part, people brought up the ideas that they were concerned with (and hoping other people were concerned about these issues too!) It tailored the event directly to the people attending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that quelled my fear of being lost was that your background wasn’t important. I recognized a lot of the participants from Twitter, especially notable academics or alt-acs that I didn’t necessarily know, but other people recognized and respected as such. But for the most part, affiliations were not included on name tags, and veteran/novice status didn’t make a difference. (However, most people were up-front about which one they were.) If you had something to contribute to the conversation, then you could contribute. It made someone like me, an undergrad with little to no experience, really feel comfortable in an environment with seasoned professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned SO much – a lot of it being over my head at this point. I participated in sessions about teaching DH to undergrads and graduate students, sustainability of DH projects, Wikipedia &amp;amp; Hacktivism, GLAMs and DH, and introduction to MediaKron. But my tailored THATCamp experience was just one of several combinations one could’ve had this past weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also loved how active Twitter was – while I couldn’t be in two places at once, I could almost pretend I was by following what people were talking about. I was bewildered by the ability to maintain a conversation when half the room had computers or smartphones right at their fingertips. But it happened – it even made the conversation better as people from outside the conference started contributing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly have nothing bad to say about THATCamp – it quelled any fears I had about DH. The more I tried to read on my own, the more confusing and distressing the ideas became – THATCamp made it simple WITHOUT the structure so often present in academia. DH is about creativity and spontaneity and devotion – everyone I interacted with (physical and virtually) at THATCamp embodied that spirit. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Archives and Moby Dick</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/archives-and-moby-dick/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-01T09:04:07-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/archives-and-moby-dick</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since entering my hiatus from weekly blog posts, I’ve returned home for the summer to enjoy the weather, catch up on reading, and relax. Well, not so much relax – that lasted about a week before I needed to get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve certainly missed writing blog posts, and since many people (primarily family and friends) are confused about what I’m doing, I thought this would be a perfect way to set the record straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days a week, I’m interning at the New Bedford Whaling Museum Research Library. Located in the historic downtown area of New Bedford, the Library’s façade allows it to hide by blending into the rest of the buildings, save the overhang in front of the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in the Library seemed like a great fit after working with Dr. Miller, and I wanted to be able to continue looking into history of New Bedford. However, I wanted to take that next step by working in an aspect of the museum I had no experience with – in this case, the work that goes into housing the archives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My assignment this summer is to create a finding aid for the Teller Papers, a collection of documents from Walter Magnes Teller. Teller was a biographer of Joshua Slocum, the first man to circumnavigate the globe alone. The Teller Papers were assessed by the library in 1989, but all we currently have is a master inventory list. The list is helpful in letting me know what is in the nine boxes and countless folders, but the materials aren’t really in an order conducive to researching. This is where I come in, with a simple job description: I put papers in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, my job IS a bit more complicated – I replace folders and papers that could be damaged by acidity or flimsiness; I chronologically organize the materials and folders so that the documents aren’t haphazardly thrown together; I put the folders in boxes in a way that makes sense to researchers; I create a document that accurately describe the contents of each folder/box concisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve finished Series A of the finding aid (correspondence.) Series A was quick and simple, because most of the correspondence had already been separated, and I just had to organize the materials within the folders. However, Series B (research materials) is taking a bit longer because there a lot more research materials than there were letters. And while looking through all of this paperwork is certainly interesting, it can certainly be exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I take a break from work, I’ve been reading Moby Dick, the famous tale of Ishmael, Queequeg, Ahab, and the whale. (I had previously only read the New Bedford-related chapters.) This historic novel is certainly one of literary importance, though it has one fault – Melville has a tendency to be REALLY wordy. He spares the reader no details about the history of whaling, the process of capturing and butchering whales, and the intimacies of crew friendship. On one hand, this is good for the reader to have the background of the whaling industry – on the other hand, it makes reading the novel EXTREMELY difficult to figure out what aspects of the story are actually important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is sort of what working with an archival collection is like, especially in the organization stage. There is an overabundance of information – all relevant to the topic at hand, but it’s difficult to tell what one actually wants to know. It’s been one week, and I can tell you all about the confusing trial towards the end of Joshua Slocum’s life, and all the ports his schooner _Pato _docked at – but is that really what is important? Do I need it to completely understand the story of Slocum’s life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is a most resounding YES for anyone else – any researcher should have access to all the information Teller had and experienced if one is to understand his analysis and documentation of Slocum’s life. But for an archivist, I’m not so sure. As much as I understand it, the archivist’s job as I understand it is not really to have complete understanding and further analysis of the works they handle. However, it IS their job to be able to maintain and manage these collections, in order for others to access and interpret. And as a researcher, I think that’s pretty cool of archivists to be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Melville’s case (at least from what I’ve read) he intended to make Moby Dick a collection of sorts, describing to 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century America the ins and outs of the whaling industry. But it was a commercial failure during Melville’s lifetime, probably for this reason – people looked at Moby Dick solely as a novel, not as an archive. I think being able to see it as both educational (archive) and sensational (novel) makes the piece that much more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Open Rehearsal/Performance Experience</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/the-open-rehearsalperformance-experience/"/>
   <updated>2014-05-20T19:12:52-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/the-open-rehearsalperformance-experience</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love watching PBS’s new web series “The Art Assignment” – partly due to John and Sarah Green, who are a fantastically creative couple with serious vlogging skills, but also because of the combination of art history and art experience. For those of you who haven’t watched I seriously suggest you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/theartassignment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt; – but the basic premise is that Sarah Urist Green (and sometimes John) travel to meet various artists, talk about types of art, and encourage viewers to try out an assignment for themselves. It gets you thinking about how art is more than our traditional expectations, and how to take those boundaries for your participation in creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, why am I talking about this? This past weekend, I participated in an Open Rehearsal at the RISD Museum in Providence, RI. It’s been a few years since I’ve &lt;/span&gt;visited RISD, but if you ever get the chance, PLEASE check it out. It’s an awesome place for people of all ages, artists or not.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Open Rehearsal/Performance is part of a  series of events that “brings dance and movement beyond the proscenium stage and into other cultural and architectural contexts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event is described in this process: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The theater is a conceptual and physical space which conventionally specifies where performers perform and where the audience sits, and a set of learned behaviors about how to spectate. Similarly the art museum is a place that collects, preserves and displays artworks, and we can enter with all kinds of expectations about how to act, how to move, and how to look. Where do we direct our attention? How do we decide what to look at and for how long? Where and how do we position and move our bodies in space in relation to the performance, to artworks? How do the performers relate to each other and to the audience as a whole and as individuals? How do we experience and express agency as viewers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Rehearsal/Performance series takes place in the Grand Gallery of the Museum. It’s a standard gallery, as far as I know – I don’t remember all of the details, but it’s a large room with various portraits from the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; – 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century (Please correct me if I’m wrong!) Once called a “temple of art,“ walking in this room gives you a sense of awe – if simply because of its size, stature, or all the historical faces staring down at you. In the conventions of a museum, you feel restricted – you feel small beside these testaments to art and human greatness, the history hung up on the walls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the performance started, I kinda had that feeling. People were talking and rushing around, these dancers were stretching in the middle of the gallery, and I couldn’t quite grasp how all this action could take place in a room dedicated to silence. I wanted to take in the paintings and the room, but the movement around me seemed distracting and out of place. I could tell the docents outside the gallery weren’t too pleased with all the commotion going on, whether or not they could say anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when the performance began and I was in the center of that room belting out “Amazing Grace,” I didn’t feel the same way. I’ve done performances very close up to audiences before, and in some unusual spaces, but this one really made me think. Normally when performing onstage or in a studio setting, you don’t get this intimate connection with an audience. But instead we shared this sense of oddness, trying to figure out how to perform in a space that wasn’t used to performance. Just as the audience had to take in where to look – the walls or the center – I had to consider who to emote to, where to get my sense of serenity in the middle of a song.  The physical and the painted audiences were watching, and I felt like I could take the energy from both. And this room designed to silence, with its 18-foot tall ceiling, practically begged me to sing out to the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I thought about the performance later on, I considered the ideas of the Art Assignment. I mean, the Grand Gallery of RISD Museum is a “temple of art” – shouldn’t dance and music and movement be included in that term? And how can we participate in that – as both a performer and as an audience? What kind of expectations does each situation conventionally have – and how can we change that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Art Assignment series, and this Open Rehearsal/Performance series as well, are about teaching people to think about the conventions of art. But it also makes us think about how artists (and those of us still working towards being artists) take these boundary conditions to create something spectacular that makes us all reconsider our ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Last Lecture</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/the-last-lecture/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-27T10:01:48-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/the-last-lecture</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;13 blog posts, 12 short essays, about 60 hours of experience, and lots of other things that could probably be measured in numbers later, HISTORY 298 is just about over. And it’s certainly been a long, enjoyable ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started on this project at the beginning of last semester, I wasn’t entirely sure what I was getting into. The email that had been sent out to history majors had required a French-speaking junior or senior – I met neither requirement. But I sent an email anyway, mostly because I was curious – &lt;em&gt;French-Canadians&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;in New Bedford?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few emails were exchanged, a few questions asked, and BAM! I was working with Laura, a PhD candidate working as the Graduate Research Assistant with Dr. Miller on the project “Ethnohistory of Ethnic Whalemen and their Communities in the New Bedford Area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just before the end of Add/Drop period, so I didn’t register for credit – at that point, I wasn’t really concerned with registering (that sounded complicated) and I wasn’t looking for anything out of this project (I just wanted to help out.) I started working with Laura, checking in with her every once and a while and primarily communicating through email. Every few weeks, she would send me a new task – nothing really difficult, mostly what I saw as busy work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of fall semester, I definitely wanted to continue working on the project, and I was hoping for some more rigorous assignments. When I asked to sign up for credit, I still wasn’t sure what I what the work would entail. Most of what I had done last semester didn’t seem to be doing anything really significant, but I liked the information and I wanted to see where it could go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To receive internship credit at UMass, one has to register through the Career Services Field Experience Office and then through the Undergraduate Advisor of the department in which one wishes to get credit, with lots of forms that I’m still not sure what they were for. But one of them involves an academic contract, which explains a) what you’re doing, b) why you’re qualified to do it, and c) what sort of academic “stuff” you’re going to do for the internship that justifies you getting credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’ve been following my blog, you know that my blog posts are a part of that academic contract. The final aspect of my portfolio requires a “5-page reflective essay at the end of the semester on what I have learned regarding the ethnohistory of New Bedford whaling and working in historical research.” So, that’s what I’m supposed to do here. (I’m not sure if I’ll accomplish that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I tell you about the ethnohistory of New Bedford whaling? Well, for starters, it existed. Though I focused more on the Jewish and Pacific Islander communities’ presence in New Bedford rather than in the whaling industry, I can tell you that their stories are there – but you have to look for them. It’s certainly been written out of the main context of New Bedford history – you can walk down the streets and see the homes of whaling captains, but you don’t necessarily remember their crew. I’d like to attribute part of this problem to the fact that the way we talk about the whaling industry isn’t necessarily focused on the people. In fact, we don’t even teach history that way, not really! We talk about ideas, concepts, and symbols – but not people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why this is – people are some of the coolest things in history. (Just check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fuckyeahhistorycrushes.tumblr.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;one of my favorite blogs devoted to history crushes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) When we do talk about the people, we talk about the “important people” – the so-called movers and shakers, the people who make a difference. In recent historiography, a new movement has taken place to dispel the idea that “important people” are the only ones fit to be remembered. (Think Howard Zinn’s &lt;em&gt;A People’s History of the United States&lt;/em&gt; or Jill Lepore’s &lt;em&gt;Book of Ages; The Life and Opinions of Jane Franklin.)&lt;/em&gt;  This involves looking at history through critical lenses (feminist, Marxist, post-colonial, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study is probably a part of that movement, a movement of which I am extremely in support. And why shouldn’t I be? I think it’s hard to determine who exactly are the movers and shakers, because these are the people who did what I’ll refer to in the rest of this post as “the dirty work.” And in whaling, there is a lot of dirty work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to step away from this for a minute, let’s talk about a different kind of dirty work – research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I used to tell people “I want to be a history professor!” I didn’t really know what I was saying. I knew the old adage “publish or perish.” But I didn’t think about the work that came behind it – the dirty work that we discussed a few weeks ago as research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Career Services expected me to get out of this internship was field experience – which in the academic field, is primarily research. So I got to do a lot of fun tasks.   The projects certainly varied – I worked with microfilm (which is still the coolest thing ever,) I looked at census records, I did archival research in various databases, and even dabbled in oral history transcription. The work wasn’t extremely difficult, but it was certainly challenging at times. However, I love a good challenge, and it provided something fun for me to do when the rest of my work was piling up. At first, I didn’t necessarily think of the applications of the work I was doing – I was given a task, and so I just went for it. Find all the people who speak Yiddish? Okay. Look for any reference to Kalākaua? Cool. And while it probably wasn’t good for my analysis or discovery, it taught me a lot about whatever program/technology/database I was using, and just informed about the time period. If I found something interesting but irrelevant, I’d write it down for my own amusement, saving it for whatever I was to write about that week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            I’m not sure at what point I started looking at this task as “just another project” to “A REALLY AWESOME PROJECT,” but it’s certainly become that way. If I had to say when it started, it was probably with the Kanaka whaleman photo. At first, I just &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to find that photo – that was the task, so it had to be completed. But as I started looking in various archives and museums, the investigation became less about finding the whaleman, and more about finding out how many routes I could take to get there. It made this project appear not as some side research for a professor, but something monumental in context with American history and whaling history and ethnic communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            And that’s where it became awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I get out of this project? In summary, a lot. A few months ago, New Bedford was just a few exits I would pass by on I-195 in order to get home to Fairhaven or Somerset. I knew of the New Bedford Whaling Museum, of course – every third-grade class within 20 miles of New Bedford goes to the Whaling Museum. But I didn’t remember the history, so much as the big whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling and the &lt;em&gt;Resolute&lt;/em&gt; desk from National Treasure 2 beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over spring break, I had to drive around New Bedford for an interview, and I certainly didn’t feel the same way. Driving around the city made me remember how much I had learned in the past few months, and how much happened on these streets. It also made me think about where this project was going, and how far I had come in the research I had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year was a new chapter, in that cheesy sort of way – I started a new school, in a new place, with new friends and new subjects, and for the first time I actually had the opportunity to pick what I wanted to do with history. People kept asking me what I wanted to study, and to be honest, I had no idea. I was one of the lucky ones – I sat down one day and decided I really wanted to study history. But what about it? That was a question for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to work with Dr. Miller gave me the opportunity to start with something new in a field to which I had a connection. And even when I didn’t know much about that connection, it allowed me to create one, to have an excuse to call home when I had a question about a street or building. In that way, working with Dr. Miller created a really interesting internship – studying these research and archival methods in context with a place close to home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            And outside of the work I was doing, one of the best parts of this for me was simply the social media experience. Through Tumblr and Twitter, I interacted with a lot of historians, researchers, and history buffs who had so many awesome ideas for me. They completely expanded my own view of what “going into history” can mean. I had never heard about the alt-ac community before Twitter, and it opened up my eyes to really see where this research is going and what people can do with it. I got a lot of responses from people inside and outside the academic community, cheering me on with my work and sometimes pointing me in the right direction. It’s awesome to see that this study is not the first of its kind – that multiple communities, museums, or parks across the nation are looking at history this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Miller asked if I wanted to continue working with her next semester, and of course I said yes! It might be difficult to fit into my schedule (I’m a highly desired student, in case you couldn’t tell) but this is a project that is really important to me – not just for the experience, but because each week I’ve found something new to be really excited about. And that’s why I chose history as my major in the first place – I want to be excited all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the blog isn’t over – just this portion is, and just for now. But I can’t wait to see what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Slightly Off-Topic: Digital Humanities</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/slightly-off-topic-digital-humanities/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-20T11:18:45-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/slightly-off-topic-digital-humanities</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since it is so close to the end of the semester, I’m not receiving tasks anymore. But before I get to my final blog post, I wanted to write about something I’m doing in another course: Honors 391A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honors 391A is a requirement of the Commonwealth Honors College at UMass, a 1-credit course of an interdisciplinary subject in depth. The topics vary widely, from the authentic self to complexities of Haiti. The one I chose, “Doing the Digital Humanities,” seemed interesting at the time, primarily because it had humanities in the title. I didn’t have a good idea of what exactly I was going to learn in the course, but it filled the requirement and it certainly piqued my interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I still can’t really tell you what Digital Humanities is, because I’m not the sure digital humanists can tell you its definition either. The term is as expansive and complex as one can imagine. My professor says digital humanities is what ten years from now will be called the humanities, which is perhaps the most descriptive and yet simple definition. In my opinion, the purpose of digital humanities comes in three forms: 1) using technology to further one’s research, whether that be through programs or presentation; 2) the expansion of access to humanities research; and 3) the use of humanist inquiry to examine technological issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section of Honors 391A, each student is expected to imagine a final project, coming up with an idea that demonstrates our understanding of digital humanities and its application to something greater. So over the course of the semester, the final project has been in the back of my mind, as I try to find something original and yet exciting to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you’re probably wondering at this point why I’m not talking about any work I’ve done with Prof. Miller. And I’m getting to that – in fact, I’ve spent most of this semester getting to that. Because I’ve found a good way to combine two projects: what more do I like to talk about than the research I’m working on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the end result of this research will be put into a study for the National Parks Service, and according to the contract, will result in some updated website and possibly a database for the National Whaling Historical Park. At the beginning of the semester, that sounded cool – I am all about quality websites and useful databases. But based on what already exists from the National Park Service and my expanded ideas of digital humanities, I want something more for the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t put together an entire presentation (that will probably follow later this week,) but I have a few ideas. Right now, most of the databases NWHP has serve as a digital exhibit – they are maps that require you to click on something for the information that would normally be placed beside it in a physical museum. It doesn’t make you think about the information so much as it just presents it to you. I want something more than that – something that will allow people to discover the whaling communities in a way that does not just pass on information, but gets others thinking about their representation and involvement in the greater society. Where did they live? What did they do? And how should we remember it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I’ll be sure to post a link to whatever presentation I make, so be on the lookout.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Are You A Researcher?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/are-you-a-researcher/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-13T12:01:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/are-you-a-researcher</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The answer is probably yes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I finished transcribing the oral history interview I started last week. (I probably went over on my allotted hours in doing so, but I really wanted to finish the majority of this project before I had to start working on my final assignments for my other courses.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            After listening to the rest of the interview (which I thoroughly enjoyed), I pasted the transcription into Word so I could review my spelling and grammatical errors. (To be honest, there were a lot of them.) I also highlighted all of the words I didn’t know how to spell(which I usually labeled “sp?”) or the words I hadn’t heard (which were marked by “[inaudible]”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            One thing that became painfully obvious as I read through the script checking for these errors was how flat words become on a page. As a blogger, I often forget this – I hear my posts in my own voice. But when you’re reading an interview, especially one you’ve heard before, the voices don’t come alive as much. The words and inflections don’t come across the same way that the two women of the interview spoke. You miss out on reading all the pauses and “ums” that frequented the conversation. Laughing doesn’t seem as exciting when you only see [laughing] on a page. And let me tell you – these women laughed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            That’s what made this interview so much fun. The two ladies, who are volunteers of the Whaling National Historical Park, truly enjoy all the hard work they have done for the projects, themselves, and the history they present. In their investigations into the Pacific Islanders’ involvement in whaling, they have truly made great strides for the community. When they realized that such information was not readily available to the public, they quickly took it upon themselves to research the stories of the Hawaiian people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            It seems like these ladies have accomplished so much in their travels – even visiting various archives of Maui and Honolulu directly. And better yet, they enjoy themselves throughout the entire research process. Though they had to be reminded that truly are researchers, they more importantly see themselves as the teachers they once were. Their goal in discovering these stories is to be able to plant a seed and make the connections that many have forgotten. Hearing them say that was truly inspirational. Because that’s what researchers are ultimately out to do – find information to plant the seed. It’s not just experience or a greater understanding of the area in context of American history. It’s about what this information can do – how it can tell the stories of people long forgotten in order to make them long remembered.  That’s one of the hats every researcher has to wear, reminding themselves why they do what they do. It’s not the money or the credit or the personal benefit, but the public and benefit the information can provide. And we should enjoy each and every step of it – it’s not always a methodical process and it can take some twists and turns. But at the end of the day, that’s part of the job – being able to make these steps lead to something greater and something amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Transcribing Is Difficult Work</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/transcribing-is-difficult-work/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-05T13:11:09-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/transcribing-is-difficult-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My supervisor sent me the task late last week: transcribing an oral history interview with volunteers of the National Park Service in New Bedford. It didn’t sound particularly difficult – while I’d never actually tried to transcribe a recording before, I considered myself a quick typist and had often had to transcribe my grandfather’s stories into concise Word documents. So, I figured it couldn’t be too difficult of a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program that was suggested to me, Express Scribe, is definitely a bit more complicated than what I was expecting. I tinkered around with some of the various icons and menus, trying to see what the program could do. (To be honest, I’m still not sure what they all do.) Finally, I loaded the MP3 and started playing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t realize how quickly people speak until you have to type every word they are saying. After ten seconds of trying to catch up at a speed of 100%, I started adjusting the scale until I could find a speed at which I felt comfortable – in my case, 43%. The slow pace didn’t quite register in my mind until I had spent a good chunk of time transcribing only to realize it had only been five minutes in the course of the MP3. While it was a minor blow to my ego, it did make me feel that I was taking the time to ensure quality of the transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One difficulty with the program was activating the “hotkeys” – rather than using my mouse to start/stop the playback, one can use they keyboard (which is helpful when mid-transcription.) I had to contact my supervisor on how to actually activate the keys, but once I did, they came as a solution to another problem – people talking over each other.  I often had to review a segment four or five times to make sure I had heard everyone’s parts correctly. This was especially difficult in the beginning of the interview – while I recognized my supervisor’s voice, I sometimes got confused on which of the two interviewees was speaking. As the piece went on, I was able to distinguish their voices more clearly – though they still talked over each other a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I’m just before the halfway point in the 83-minute interview, so I still have my work ahead of me in that regard. However, what was really interesting about this experience was being able to hear how open and descriptive the two volunteers were in the interview. Though I don’t have any personal experience with oral history interviews, I’ve heard some horror stories – difficult to get in touch with people, people who were reserved, controversial responses, no response, etc. This one, however, seemed to go quite well. It was unscripted, directed by the stories and anecdotes that came out in conversation rather than the few, distinct questions presented. My supervisor asked very few, clear-cut questions – mostly clarifications on a name or a date – and instead asked broad, open-ended ones that allowed the conversations to take several different directions. It’s definitely something to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the actual topic of the interview, I was amazed by the amount of effort and determination the two volunteers put into their independent research project for their program and for their personal understanding of the ethnic communities of New Bedford and the whaling industry. However, since that’s an entirely different topic, I’ll save it for when I actually finish transcribing the interview. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Where In The World Is The Whaleman?</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/where-in-the-world-is-the-whaleman/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-30T11:41:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/where-in-the-world-is-the-whaleman</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, returned to the task of the whaleman – he may have been found, but his story has not. Let me explain – in the photo, the whaleman is standing in front of a doorway. This doorway’s sole distinguishing feature is the number 47. In discussing this with an archivist, he jokingly suggested looking through all the “47’s” in the New Bedford directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s exactly what I did. I started searching for some database that could provide that sort of information. I wasn’t entirely sure of what sort of database I was looking for – was I looking for a map or some sort of directory that would provide every address in the city?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found exactly what I was looking for in the Digital Sanborn Maps Database. The maps were initially created to assist fire insurance companies with assessing the risk associated with insuring a particular property. They identified buildings by the house and block numbers, but also contained information such as size, shape and construction materials, heights, and function of building, among others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each map on the database is divided into sheets, which show a specific block or collection of blocks within a city. The maps were accompanied by a very detailed key, which labeled number of floors, size of buildings, location of doors, etc. For the most part, I didn’t need this key, but it would be interesting from an architectural standpoint (and something to keep in mind for the future.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Bedford has several different maps, charting its growth and development as a city, but the one closest to the time the photo was taken was the map of November 1888. Divided into 33 sheets, I certainly had my work cut out for me. But overall, it was fairly simple to use. I found it frustrating that while you could easily zoom in and out, you couldn’t easily manipulate the map. This made it difficult, for example, when I found the number 47, but I had to go to a different section of the map to see what street it was on. In retrospect, it was really just a minor inconvenience, but something the database could improve upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this map is over 100 years old and the city of New Bedford has changed immensely, I could recognize some of the neighborhoods and streets. The easiest markers, of course, were the Seamen’s Bethel and the Mariner’s Home. From there, I was able to somewhat understand what Prof. Miller when she talked about how the streets had changed so much. I could put in context where these familiar buildings are today, and visualize the streets of New Bedford back then.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a West Islander, I loved being able to see the connections between New Bedford and Fairhaven (which at this point was all on one map.) Without I-195 connecting the two towns, it was interesting to see how the former “Bridge Street” linked the towns together. (This is an unrelated anecdote, but Fairhaven’s Bridge Street today no longer leads to a bridge – the new bridge was reconstructed along Huttleston Avenue, named for the town’s benefactor and superintendent of streets, Henry Huttleston Rogers.) Since I have researched that side of the river much more extensively than the New Bedford side, it was exciting to visualize myself driving down some of those streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to identify a handful of buildings numbered 47 throughout New Bedford. I expected to find a lot more, but this number is good – thanks to the Sanborn maps, I could also see what type of buildings these were – a few dwellings, a few stores, and one dancing establishment. I really hope this isn’t a dead end, and I hope this 47 leads to something greater in the scheme of the project. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>3/26/14: The Power of the Image</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/32614-the-power-of-the-image/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-28T13:56:26-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/32614-the-power-of-the-image</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week in the Digital Humanities Lab, we were presented with two new programs that allow people to create 3D models. At first, it was slightly harder to understand their applications to &lt;em&gt;humanities&lt;/em&gt; – they seemed more like engineering tools than programs designed for history majors. Both Sketchup and PhotoScan look a lot more complicated than many of their previous programs we discussed. (It might just have been me though – I’m not the most adept person when it comes to manipulating image programs.) But in their increased level of difficulty, they provide greater opportunities for entertainment and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PhotoScan was presented as a very practical, analytical tool. Essentially, PhotoScan involves taking a lot of careful, distinctive photos of an object or place and aligning them to create a model. I can see that it takes a lot of time and precision, but the end result truly is amazing. It could take into account the depth, texture, and color, and ultimately provide you with an image very similar to the actual object (that is, if you do it right.) I wonder how it would work with photos not necessarily taken from the same camera – for example, could you recreate the day of JFK’s assassination from the various filmstrips and videos that are available? Can we recreate moments of history, or at least attempt to, in order to get a better sense of the moment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sketchup, on the other hand, seemed to have more theoretical applications. What I loved about Sketchup is that not only can you have an idea of what a space looks like, but you can also see the possibilities a space can provide. It reminded me of shows on the HGTV Network, where they convince that you in five minutes or less that the awful backyard or fixer-upper home can become the dream paradise you want it to be. It’s a program that would’ve been great for all those times I tried to rearrange my room as a kid, only to find out that placing my bookcase by the window would cover up the majority of the outlets. And imagine what my childhood on the Internet would’ve looked like, creating worlds in Sketchup. I could have rearranged my room within worlds like Hogwarts, Westereos, or Middle Earth (though I might not have had the patience to do that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But think of the archaeological applications of Sketchup – take a room like those of Pompeii. What could have taken place in there? What was its purpose? How does it fit in with the rest of the building, or even other buildings around it? Can we begin to theorize how people used this space, and how to present that to the public?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both programs, I thought of the same question: how does your perception of an object or space change when you can see all of its aspects? How does your perception change when you can see things on a large &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; small scale? When you have the ability to see more than one perspective, the possibilities are endless. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>One Short Day in the Archives</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/one-short-day-in-the-archives/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-23T09:48:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/one-short-day-in-the-archives</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ah, spring break – the time when college students put aside their studies to relax, have fun, and maybe even travel to some warm destination. Well, I guess I &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to do all three of those – unfortunately, the weather didn’t quite cooperate for that last one, and I ended up in Washington D.C. with a couple inches of snow on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            After last week’s exciting discovery, I was able to take it a step further and make an appointment in the Archives Center of the National Museum of American History. I got right off the plane at BWI and quickly made my way through rush-hour traffic to the National Mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once inside, I was met by one of the archives assistantat the information desk. From there, we went through a few coded doors and long hallways to reach the Archives Reading Room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            The Reading Room was a crowded space, slightly smaller than one of the Elm classrooms here at UMass. I locked my items outside the room, save my phone and some of my notes. Once in the room, I was briefed by a fun Smithsonian PowerPoint set to cool jazz, reminding me of how to make an appointment with the archives and how to handle some of the documents. It felt a little intimidating at first – explaining all the forms and the regulations in taking physical or digital notes – but the director was very helpful in answering all of my questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;            After all the proper paperwork was filled out, I used the finding aid to request a few of the boxes in the collection. I was specifically looking for three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)    The Kanaka whaleman photo! Of course, I already knew this one existed, but I really wanted the experience of seeing it in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)    The whalemen’s boarding house mentioned in Bulletin #27&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)    Any reference to Smilie or the US Fish Commission visiting New Bedford&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first box in the collection was supposed to have records of correspondence and authorizations for the US Fish Commission, so I was hoping to find something for item #3. The first thing in the box was a large journal, noting every important appropriation, authorization, or appointment. Unlike many of the documents I would find later, the handwriting was quite easy to read, which made looking for key terms like “Smilie,” “New Bedford,” and “whaling.” Unfortunately, nothing came up, though it was cool to read about the 1883 London International Fisheries Exhibition from invitation to review. The other letters in the collection were interesting to review, though the majority of them were written long after the years I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next three boxes were all photo collections, which required me to wear what the director called “debutante gloves.” I was extremely careful, taking the time to view everything  – the fishermen, the houses, the towns and cities. Many of the pictures were taken in New England, so it was neat to recognize different spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there it was, right where the archivist had told it would be – the Kanaka whaleman photo. “Awesome” does not begin to describe what it was like to see it in person. It’s not that big – about the size of a regular piece of paper – but the writing and detail was clear. I had to keep myself from interrupting the other researchers with my excitement, though they could probably tell by the enormous smile on my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found the photo of the whalemen’s boarding house, though I didn’t realize it right away. The first time I saw the photo, it didn’t have any markers or identifiers that matched the description I had (which had been one of the easier ways to find the whaleman’s photo.) However, it did say New Bedford on the front, so I took a picture of it to go back to later.  Once it was time to sign off that I had viewed the collection, I took a moment to go through my notes and found the photo number of the whaleman’s house I was looking for – it matched the one of the Mariner’s Home photo in the file!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent about two hours in the archives, looking through all four boxes and dozens of folders. When my time was all set, I let the director know and found my way back into the museum. (My first stop once out of the archives? The maritime history exhibit, in which I saw many of the items from Bulletin #27.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about my time in the archives was simply the feeling that I was an actual researcher. Not to downplay any of the work I’ve done so far, but handling the letters and photos firsthand is an experience similar to those of looking through old scrapbooks of my family. Being in the reading room might have shut me out from the rest of the world, but it made me connect with the primary sources. It certainly won’t be my last experience in an archive, but I’m so glad a Smithsonian got to be my first. I hope it feels this amazing each time I make a find or I get the chance to be hands-on in my research.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The (Not-So) Elusive Whaleman</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/the-not-so-elusive-whaleman/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-15T19:01:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/the-not-so-elusive-whaleman</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, to start: make sure you have read &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/77606930479/the-elusive-whaleman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;this post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you want more background information, take a moment to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/79054290033/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-archives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; this one&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now back to this week. In addition to some of the other fantastic things that happened to me this week (thanks to the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/79164007365/achievement-of-the-week-and-its-only-monday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Institution &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/79602120671/so-excited-see-the-fifth-link-thats-me-the&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Archives&lt;/a&gt;,) one VERY EXCITING discovery was made in my research. It’s been hard to hold this back for so long (I wanted to post it here right away) but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I FOUND THE &lt;strike&gt;ELUSIVE&lt;/strike&gt; WHALEMAN!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so if you want to speak technically, I wasn’t the one who found him. I took the results of the previous week and contacted the Reference Request Team at the Smithsonian Archives, eager to hear back about the contents of Records Unit 95. However, being the impatient person that I am, I decided to do a little digging on their website, where I was introduced to the email of an assistant archivist. I quickly sent her the information I had compiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About an hour later, the archivist responded: unfortunately, the elusive whaleman was not in any of the series of RU95. But, she had an idea: she was going to pursue a different route in the National Anthropological Archives, and let me know ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple hours later, in the midst of afternoon classes, I received a series of emails. It appears that the records were located in the Archives Center at the National Museum of American History. She sent me the finding aid of the U.S. Fish Commission collection, and highlighted the most likely boxes and file folders for its location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This email had then been forwarded to an archivist of the collections at the National Museum of American History, who had taken the time to search the Bulletin #27 collection and found the whaleman – box 8, folder 1, 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; to the last photo. Attached to the email was a low-res scan of &lt;strong&gt;the photo itself!&lt;/strong&gt; (I’m not sure what the restrictions or licenses are involved with the photo, so to stay on the safe side, I won’t share it on my blog for now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you – it was difficult to sit through the rest of class, and I had to keep myself from running out and going to share this with everyone. So I waited the remaining few minutes and contacted just about everyone who knew about the search with my results. Naturally, none were as excited as my supervisors and I. Finding this photo was amazing for the presentation – not only because we were looking for it for so long, but because it blew away our expectations as well. The cyanotype shows the Kanaka whaleman standing in front of a building, dressed in a suit. He’s quite a dapper gentleman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels great to have found this picture – I know that I’ve said that part of research is not finding things, but another part of it is ACTUALLY FINDING THINGS. And even better, actually finding things often leads to more questions than answers. In this case: where is the whaleman standing? Can we find out who he is? Did Smilie have anything to say about it? What about the other photographs in the collection – what can these photos tell us? WHAT MORE IS THERE? (Obviously, this is all a little overwhelming at first, so that’s probably why I delayed writing this article.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan for the next week or so is to continue on this lead – find a few more photos, find some more information, and continue taking in this achievement. It’s also spring break – and to make this story more interesting, I’m actually on my way to Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was unable to book an appointment at the in the archives at the NMAH, I was able to squeeze in an appointment to see the whaleman’s picture in person. So while this is slightly disappointing, it’s still fantastic. Here’s to the next part of my research story of the semester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone involved in the search, and I’m extremely excited to know I will be seeing the whaleman in person this Tuesday!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Archives</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-archives/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-09T10:01:50-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-archives</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With a title like that, I’m sure you know what this week’s post is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a little like Captain Ahab in &lt;em&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/em&gt; (which has just been added to my spring-break reading list!) looking for this “Elusive Whaleman” of two weeks ago. I didn’t have much to go on, other than the photographer (Thomas Smilie,) the location (New Bedford,) and a purpose (the International Fisheries Exhibition.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching through archives is a complicated process anyway, so attempting to start at one of (if not the) largest archives was probably not the best idea. But if anything, I’m living up to my nickname (Quad-E: The fourth E is for extreme.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Smithsonian Archives certainly don’t look intimidating –the website is fairly user-friendly, and they provide lots of information depending on the audience. For researchers, they provide finding aids, digital media, and even an FAQ page for people like me, who have no idea what they’re doing. What I really appreciated were the explanation pages – talking about the various staff positions and how each team contributes to the archives in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the pages I took most interest in was “Survey the Archives’ most frequently used collections.” Of course I was curious – what kind of research did people look for from the Smithsonian? Perhaps obvious (though it didn’t quite come to me that way), but most the frequently used special collections were not artifacts from other places, but artifacts about the Smithsonian itself. One of the more interesting records was the Smithsonian Oral History Collection. According to the website, “Since 1973, the Archives’ Oral History Program has conducted interviews with current and retired Smithsonian staff, and others who have made significant contributions to the Institution. The purpose of the program is to supplement the written documentation of the Archives’ records and manuscript collections, focusing on the history of the Institution.” It seemed like a bit meta – an archive taking archives about itself – but it’s certainly cool to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the record I am looking for happened to the list – Records Unit 95, Photograph Collection, 1850s. This record compiles a lot about the early history of the Smithsonian. Divided into 10 series, it consists of photographs of people, places, things, and events of the Institution. Interestingly enough, it’s also one of the most digitized collections – if you look here on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/smithsonian/sets/72157604590559182/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flickr&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can see some of Smilie’s work from this collection. And I did look through it – lots of Smilie’s work shows up, whether they are part of exhibits or simply pictures of buildings. But here’s the important part – one of those series is entitled “Expositions” – photos of expositions in which the Smithsonian (and museums) took part. Though it’s not confirmed, the photo Smilie took of the Kanaka whaleman should be in that file, as it was part of the 1883 London International Fisheries Exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the next step: delving into Records Unit 95. I’m really excited to see if anything turns up from this search – and I’m really glad that I got a chance to navigate through the confusion that is collection and searches. The thing I love about history is that the more time you put into your research, the more information and knowledge comes out. Not only did I figure out a little bit more about the Smithsonian, but I learned the valuable skill of maneuvering through these records (something I hope I will be able to put to good use.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your fingers crossed – I have a hunch that the Elusive Whaleman will appear soon 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I ended up getting ahead on my assignments (and took a break from studying for my HIST397GGH midterm on Thursday) and was able to get a lot of other work done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I applied for another internship: I’ve now applied for three history-related internships in my area (and planning on one more), so I hope I’ll hear something soon!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I also applied for a scholarship to attend a course this summer course about the Whitfield-Manjiro story and whaling history of Fairhaven.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I then emailed my supervisor about some of my leads in the Smithsonian Archives (on which I will probably write this week’s blog post, because Archives are extremely complicated and I love it.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>If Research Was A Plane, Nobody Would Get On.</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/if-research-was-a-plane-nobody-would-get-on/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-02T14:12:49-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/if-research-was-a-plane-nobody-would-get-on</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week felt like a long one – in more ways than one. It’s right around that time of the semester for midterms and housing discussions and lots of assignments. The prospects of spring break and the possibility of warm weather are right around the corner. Emotions and tensions can get to a breaking point.  And I happened to have the pleasure of being in the middle of all of it – stress seemed to be everywhere I turned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To escape, I decided to return to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sheishistoric.tumblr.com/post/76698024919/a-failed-challenge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Failed Challenge&lt;/a&gt; of a few weeks ago: could I find any trace of Queen Liliuokalani’s cancelled visit in New Bedford’s &lt;u&gt;Morning Mercury&lt;/u&gt;? I spent my few hours tucked away in the silent microfilm room, endlessly searching that one reel for a glimpse of her name.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a lot of interesting information – for example, did you know that President McKinley had been invited to New Bedford’s semicentennial? (He, like the ex-queen, politely declined.) Did you know President McKinley had sent several senators to Hawaii, working with the people to speed along Hawaiian annexation? (It appears it did not go over well with the Hawaiian people.) Did you know that Princess Ka’iulani, next in line to the throne, was considered quite the celebrity of the time? (Her travels through Europe and her time in England, as well as her prospective return to the United States to visit Liliuokalani, were frequently mentioned in &lt;u&gt;The Morning Mercury&lt;/u&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while all of this was interesting, none of it directly related to my real purpose for the search. By the end of the week, the one thing I had hoped might bring me a lapse from my stress could not. Once again, I had failed to find my answers. To be honest, I left the library in a huff of frustration, headed home for a rough weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue being honest, I wasn’t entirely sure what I was going to write for this week’s blog post. After all, I had nothing to show for my work this week, no evidence of my hours with the reels, no information worth passing on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to start, I was about to title this piece “A Failed Challenge, Pt. 2.” However, I was reminded of what Prof. Miller had told me after she read my previous piece. In history, there is rarely such a thing as a failed challenge. Or rather, most of history is a failed challenge. As a historian, when I go searching for information or documents or pictures, I am often searching for something that no one else has found. Nine times out of ten, I am not going to find what it is I am looking for. And that’s okay – great, even! That’s the kind of stuff historians and researchers deal with everyday! What I have experienced is partly a failed challenge – one that did not result in what I was looking for – but also a successful challenge – in that I did learn something. And so while the pain of not getting what I wanted is still frustrating, it’s good to know that at some point, everyone gets to this point. But don’t they keep researching? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, instead, I chose a line from one of my favorite songs – “If Love Was A Plane” by Brad Paisley. The song, which discusses the pleasures and heartbreaking realities of relationships, states that the odds of a relationship working out are six in ten. As Paisley points out, if a plane had odds like that, no one would ever fly. But we don’t tell people that at the start of a relationship, do we?  As Prof. Miller pointed out to me, research of this kind has worse odds – a factor that I hadn’t realized until I had to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This internship (like most internships) is one where I am supposed to earn practical work experience in a field of interest. And in research, what I call “failure” is practical work experience. So I know that I will experience many more “failures” (though hopefully not in the course of this project, because I would like to have more varied blog posts.) But I also know that “failure” is a common result for what I am doing. I need to take the bridge and last refrain of the song in mind. Even though I know the chances of finding exactly what I’m looking for are small, to hell with the odds – I’m going to keep moving forward in my research. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Elusive Whaleman</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/the-elusive-whaleman/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-23T13:01:18-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/the-elusive-whaleman</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After struggling with microfilm last week (still working on Queen Liliuokalani, by the way) I moved onto my new assignment. This time, I investigated a different aspect of whaling: the international connection it created. Specifically, I was asked to go through a report by the U.S. Fish Commission &amp;amp; the United States National Museum in order to document every item donated by a New Bedford person/firm to the 1883 International Fisheries Exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I talked with my supervisor about this, I discovered one more hidden goals of this project – a task I’ve named “The Elusive Whaleman.” The title refers to a photo of a New Bedford Kanaka [native of Sandwich/Hawaiian islands] whaleman that was taken by Smithsonian photographer Thomas William Smillie. So far, we haven’t found a trace of the picture – only its description as Photo No. 2134 remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo was one of several photos of New Bedford in the United States collection at the exhibition. A majority of the photos were of residences of successful ship captains, though there were several featuring people. Some of the others included in the collection featured an African whaleman, Azorean Portuguese whalemen, and a group of skippers. I briefly looked more in-depth into Smillie’s visit to New Bedford, but I didn’t find anything on the Internet. I did notice, however, that Smillie’s photos often featured minority populations alongside portraits of the rich and famous. I’m curious if this is a personal choice (Smillie wanting to represent all aspects of society) or a commissioned choice (the United States National Museum making this scientifically beneficial decision.) Either way, it’s great for documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I did some minor investigation into the Smithsonian Archives to see if I could find any clues as to where our Elusive Whaleman might be hiding. I was only recently introduced into divulging the secrets of archives, so I definitely struggled in searching. One obvious drawback is the size of archives – with hundreds of thousands of collections, not all of them are properly digitized or particularly detailed.  I’m hoping that this week I’ll be able to learn how to utilize the archives to my advantage and possibly find the Elusive Whaleman’s location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I couldn’t find much about the photo, I did learn a lot about the tools of whaling. And by a lot, I mean &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A LOT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Over 180 items were donated from New Bedford. Some were photos (as mentioned before,) some were crew logs or captain’s logs, and some were bones of various whales. But the majority of these items were the physical tools of whaling. Most of them were obvious – bone-scrapers, for example, are used for cleaning whalebones. Others sounded weird – like a belly-band, which is used to lower a man over the side of a ship at sea. There were (in my opinion) too many harpoons – all of different length and sizes depending on what type of whale one was shooting at. But my favorite items were the ones that seemed odd to send to an exhibition. For example, the U.S. Fish Commission sent a pair of whaleman’s hand-cuffs in the collection, which were used for “enforcing discipline, manacling insubordinate, pugilistic, or drunken members of the crew, and deserters if caught.” It’d certainly be something cool to see, but was that really important to describe aspects of American whaling to the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew the basics of the whaling industry, but I hadn’t necessarily considered every aspect of its process – from the moment one leaves port to the moment one had whale oil in their home to light something. While an overwhelming amount of information (and not always the most interesting to read,) it was actually cool to have some idea of what these whalers were actually doing. It reminded me of today’s shows like Deadliest Catch, where viewers get to know the crew members and the process of catching our supply of fish. On the surface, it sounds boring (at least, it does to me) – but taking the time to learn the ins and outs of the process allowed for fuller knowledge and understanding of the difficult process of whaling. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Omeka!</title>

   <updated>2014-02-19T21:09:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/omeka</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So now that my digital humanities class is in full swing, each “team” has to make a presentation about the software they are using. (I put team in quotation marks because not every team is made up of multiple people – a few of the programs are run by just one person, like me!) This week, I presented first! Here’s a transcript of what I talked about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! My name is Emily, and I’m on the Omeka team for our chapel project. I chose to work with Omeka because as I did a lot of reading about digital humanities and talked with twitterstorians,  Omeka was one program that kept coming up. It seemed like this essential, basic tool that I just had to learn more about if I wanted to investigate the field. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;According to the Omeka website, Omeka is a Swahili word meaning to display or lay out wares; to speak out; to spread out; to unpack. Those definitions have very different implications, and Omeka meets all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At a first glance, Omeka sounds like a digital museum – it has “exhibits” and “collections.” And in some ways, that’s exactly what Omeka is. It’s a software combination that uses web content management, collections management, and archival digital collections systems. That sounds like a lot, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I asked on Twitter, here are some of the definitions I received:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Patrick Murray-John (Omeka dev team manager): Web publishing for people who love them some metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Michelle Kassorla (Digital Humanist): Omeka is an open source archival-quality digital curation tool. It’s built to archive standards so that data can be read in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Website: “Omeka is a software tool that enables you to create dynamic online exhibits that showcase collections of digital images, text, and other multi-media formats in one seamless site.” It’s great for realistically anyone – scholars wanting to share primary source collections or dissertation, museum professionals who want to show sensitive materials, librarians to show off an online catalog, educators, enthusiasts, or archivists!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For us, it’s a great tool to organize and display the documents or artifacts we find about the Old Chapel! Specifically, it allows us to display these items, tell a story with these items, and preserve complete information (just like we did with the metadata team last week!)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Omeka organizes content in two ways: Items and Collections. They’re fairly self-explanatory – items are individual files, while collections are grouped items. You can have sections (equivalent to a museum room) and pages (equivalent to the walls of a room.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here are some cool examples of what our Omeka site could look like:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://silveragecomics.omeka.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://silveragecomics.omeka.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tmsarchives.omeka.net/collections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://tmsarchives.omeka.net/collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is what our class page CURRENTLY looks like: &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://honors391spr2014.omeka.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://honors391spr2014.omeka.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Failed Challenge</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/a-failed-challenge/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-14T23:19:11-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/a-failed-challenge</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, I was met with a challenge I could not meet. As my final microfilm assignment (for the time being), I was asked to look into the invitation of ex-queen Liliuokalani to New Bedford’s semi-centennial. According to a scrapbook my supervisor found at the New Bedford Whaling Museum, the ex-queen was invited to the celebration and to the surprise of everyone, she accepted. As written in the file, “the celebration committee was quite disturbed just what to do with an ex-queen and her attendants, but later the Queen recalled her acceptance.” My job was to look into any articles referring to her potential visit and her backing out. Our theory was that the committee wasn’t expecting her to accept, and panicked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semi-centennial and Liliuokalani, were advertised across the country – I found articles mentioning the event everywhere from New York City to San Francisco – so I didn’t think it would be quite difficult to find information about it from &lt;u&gt;The Morning Mercury.&lt;/u&gt; I started in July 1897, looking for any mentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a few articles about the Queen, and plenty about the semi-centennial, but nothing pertaining the two of them. The closest I got was an article in early October, briefly mentioning how visitors from “as far away as Honolulu” had been invited to the ceremony.  However, they did not include her on the list of invited guests – by that point, I assume, she had already declined the offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I could find about Liliuokalani is the following: while her earlier visits had attempted to prevent the annexation of Hawaii, it seemed almost impossible now. Instead, she was pleading with President McKinley to support an overthrow of the current Hawaiian administration in favor of a new election allowing all citizens to vote.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; However, she continued protesting the Hawaiian annexation, saying she only abdicated the throne due to death threats, the Hawaiian people did not support annexation and that she would do whatever it would take to prevent it from happening. In fact, according to the San Francisco Call, “Liliuokalani…has accepted a nattering invitation to attend in a few weeks the reunion at New Bedford, Mass., of the old whalers. They hope to be able to assist her in her opposition to annexation with its implied control of the islands.”&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn2&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;  From what I gathered in &lt;u&gt;The Morning Mercury&lt;/u&gt;, the ex-queen was traveling from Washington to San Francisco, and then at some point made her way back to Chicago. However, the details of her journey weren’t exactly clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the semi-centennial, it certainly looked like an event to remember.  Distinguished guests from all around the region were invited. Letters of congratulations were received from the governor and president.  The grand event took place over five days, with programs everyday hosted by local groups and businesses. I haven’t researched the actual date of the semi-centennial yet, so my details are still vague, but I can’t wait to find out more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don’t know the reason why Liliuokalani rescinded the offer, so the journey continues into next week. I’ll especially take a closer look into the last few weeks of the reel, around the time of the San Francisco Call article. But this week reminded me of the struggle that comes with research. The answers aren’t always there – and when they are, it takes a lot more effort than just a few hours reading through a week of newspapers. I love a challenge – and it certainly makes this story more interesting as I read more and more about the situation. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2/12/14: To The Lab!</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/21214-to-the-lab/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-13T15:23:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/21214-to-the-lab</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Prof. Poehler took our HONS391A class to the Digital Humanities Lab to begin our Class Group Project. It quite literally opened a door to new experiences and new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I didn’t even realize there was a downstairs to Herter. I spend so much time in that building as it is, I didn’t think there could be more to discover. But the Annex proved me wrong, revealing the exciting world of the Translation Center  (and the tunnel to Bartlett, though that’s not entirely relevant to my story) as well as the impressiveness that is the digital humanities lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lab is quite a large space – it’s slightly bigger than your average classroom in Herter.  It reminded me of the computer labs in high school – a table in the center and desktops by the walls. Once everyone had arrived, Prof. Poehler gave us a synopsis of our goals for the day.  Our assignment was to help in digitizing materials about the Old Chapel building from UMass Libraries Special Collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Poehler had divided the lab into our various teams for the day: Scanning, OCR, Metadata, and Editing. I was assigned to the scanning team, which meant I was the team that started it all. Prof. Poehler gave my teammate and I a brief rundown of the BookDrive Mini as he put the finishing touches on the system’s set-up. We had some technological issues at first – cameras can be fickle tools – but we soon had the system working correctly. It’s a fairly simple machine. Two cameras are positioned up above at 45-degree angles. Below, you place a paper on top of a V-shaped plate and place your book (or in our case, book) on the corresponding side. Once the pages are in place, you pull down the glass plate, and click to take the picture. From there, we saved it to a file so the other teams could work on their portion of the task.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with older documents firsthand was awesome, partly because I love working with old documents and partly because I recognized a lot of the information. There were letters written by President Butterfield, programs from the old chapel services, and copies of floor plans during its construction, just to name a few. As a UMass Student, this kind of work is really exciting. The Old Chapel is an integral feature of the UMass campus, representing its growth from the Massachusetts Agricultural College to the major research university of today. Being able to read through these documents gave me a better perspective of how important the Chapel really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also a great experience to be able to take part in their preservation. Even in working with some of these papers, we had to be careful not to make any creases, not to rip the paper when removing staples, and not to smear any of the ink. It really impressed upon me the advantages of digitization.  I mean, I already know most of the advantages – I work with digitized materials all the time. Most of the documents I receive in class are from JSTOR, a digital library of academic journals, books, and primary sources. In my internship, I’ve been drowning in reels of microfilm. And thank goodness for the Internet, allowing me to find things relevant to my research. As a historian, my job is to interpret these sources. But as a digital historian, my job is to make these sources available in order to make such interpretations and research possible. Machines like the BookDrive make digitization a lot simpler and accessible, and are essential to the work of the humanities in general. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Perspectives</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/perspectives/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-09T16:03:56-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/perspectives</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Because I’m still focusing on my microfilm projects, I haven’t had much of an opportunity to explore a new database – not that I mind, of course. This week, my assignments were researching the placement of the plaque outside the Seamen’s Bethel, and the construction of the original Tiferes (now Tifereth) Synagogue. Growing up in such a historic area, monuments or buildings such as these often go by the wayside. But when I took the time to research them, my perspective of New Bedford and its people changed greatly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, while looking into the construction of the Tiferes Synagogue, I found myself learning a lot more than about the construction of a synagogue. I studied the three waves of Jewish immigration (Spanish/Portuguese, German, Eastern Europe), their struggles to establish houses of worship, and the movement of the Jewish community within the city itself. One of the outside sources I used provided a “Historical Tour of Jewish New Bedford” – highlighting not just the synagogues, but cemeteries, memorials, stores, and theatres. The Jewish community created not just a religious presence in the area, but cultural and economic presences as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this contributes immensely to the purpose of the study at hand – a greater understanding of New Bedford. People (and by people, I include myself) have a tendency to forget that history is a collaborative effort, consisting of multiple ethnicities and communities. Just because we don’t recognize the important contributions of various groups today doesn’t downplay their importance. It only shows how we have chosen to have our past remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we don’t take into account everyone involved, we begin to erase the importance of their participation. For example, Professor Miller told me the story of “The Whalemen” statue outside of the New Bedford Public Library_._ Initially, when the sculptor requested a model, a Cape de Verde man was sent to him. However, in order to represent the “early Yankee courage” of New Bedford, they instead sent over a white man.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories like this one are important – they give us insight into the ways we have rewritten history before. It is a historian’s job to interpret and present the past to each other and to the public – and therefore, it is part of my job to consider these revisions in line with the actual truth. As all historians must do (and as this project is attempting to present,) we must realize that there is always more to the story than what the past initially presents. History is such a major topic, and while it seems like a macroscopic subject, we should take “lenses” – religious, cultural, economic, feminist – in order to see microscopic views of times in history. We can’t overlook the contributions of these minority populations, because that’s only looking at a portion of the story.  A better historian (and a wiser person) makes the effort not to fall in the trap of the past, and give us a fresher (perhaps clearer) perspective. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Adventures in Microfilm</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/adventures-in-microfilm/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This semester, I have certainly gotten off to a running start. My classes are great, my internships are busy, and I’ve even been making new friends – well, if you consider ILLiad a friend. Interlibrary loan has been my lifeline as I’ve attempted to get work done for HIST 298.  I’ve made over a dozen requests, and the reels are coming in much faster than I can look at them. I actually have to restrain my microfilm time to two hours, because otherwise I would spend whole days looking at newspapers from the nineteenth century.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microform viewing area is in an obvious place in the library, so it’s odd I hadn’t noticed it before. It’s a small, quiet, dark room with large desktops and strange-looking machines out of a science fiction movie. It was certainly overwhelming at first – there were so many buttons and lenses, I spent my first day just trying to figure out how to get the best scans for my portfolio. But now I can load and unload reels like a pro, and find exactly what I need. It still takes a few tries to get a good, focused scan of the paper, but I’m sure that will come with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have very specific tasks, I do get to take a few minutes to find other interesting tidbits. I love seeing mentions of familiar places, like the Fairhaven Railroad (which is now a beloved bike path) or Durfee Union Mills (where I used to work.) I also love reading through the advertisements – some were sexist, some were funny, and some were downright weird. (I kept a file of my favorite ones for posterity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real issue of the week for me was this: In the era of digitization, is any of this technology even relevant anymore? Newspapers are a dying breed – I notice this everyday when I walk by a stack of unopened &lt;em&gt;Daily Collegian&lt;/em&gt; papers in my residence hall. Isn’t microfilm headed the same way? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, it’s hard to understand why such microfilm readers are relevant anymore. They’re enormous and bulky, reels can be hard to come by, and it seems like a lot of work for one small picture. But there’s something magical about microfilm that a digital image just can’t reciprocate. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/microfilming.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NARA&lt;/a&gt; [National Archives and Records Administration], microfilm does have its benefits. Its low-cost, low-equipment storage and reliability is great for the stability of a historian’s work. Other than the necessity for instant access that only digital images can provide, microfilm seems to have the tenacity and staying power to be around for a long&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, part of the fun of microfilm is the fact that it IS old – that by using it, I’m saddled with the magnitude of working with an older technology alongside these primary documents. When historians talk about “diving into the archives,” I think you actually need the experience of working with these older technologies for a historical experience that digital ones can’t provide just yet. Unlike online sources like Ancestry, where I can put myself anywhere and be sucked back into history, the microform viewing area requires me to be aware of the weight of what I’m doing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work with microfilm isn’t quite done yet – I still have several rolls of film on hold at the Circulation Desk – so my adventures in microfilm are not quite over. And, might I add, neither is microfilm’s adventures in the work of historians. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rev. Mr. Thurber&#8217;s Poem to the Seamen&#8217;s Bethel</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/rev-mr-thurbers-poem-to-the-seamens-bethel/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-01T21:45:12-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/rev-mr-thurbers-poem-to-the-seamens-bethel</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working through a few projects this past week for my internship, and working with the microfilm has certainly been exciting! (But more on that later.) One of my tasks was looking into the history of the plaque outside the Seamen’s Bethel in New Bedford. I found this poem, printed in &lt;em&gt;The Morning Mercury&lt;/em&gt;, which was read at the tablet’s ceremony. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just one hundred years ago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When people and ships were very slow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And this town was full of men and boys you know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for a ship on a whaling voyage to go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They came from every shore and land&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Greenland’s icy mountains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From India’s coral strand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where Afric’s sunny fountains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roll down their golden sand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like waifs upon the ocean they drifted o’er the Sea of Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With few to aid or pity them as they struggled with sin and strife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Twas then our fathers saw the need&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of a “Seamen’s Bethel” so to grant them moral and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spiritual shelter indeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So the founding of this Bethel came within their sacred plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For to snatch from the vile the vicious and the brothel every single sailor man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How well their work was finished we want the world to know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the Sailor’s Church our fathers builded has lived through gale, flood, and fire since one hundred years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The builders of this Seamen’s Bethel have long since gone to their eternal rest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our ships with their crews of that ago their final resting places well – God knows best&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the “Seamen’s Bethel” treasured and held in hallowed memory by them so&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still lives for she was founded upon a rock one hundred years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a twofold manner ‘tis not fiction but ‘tis true&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That boulder girths our harbor and it binds Johnny Cake Hill too&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upon that rock this dear old Bethel stands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still another rock is her foundation which can ne’er be destroyed by the use of mortal hands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With that truth the hearts of our fathers were aglow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our fathers who preached here one hundred years ago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Christ is that rock upon which she is founded&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By His “Sea of Love” like an island all men are surrounded&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From her pulpit this theme has been preached through&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summer’s heat and winter’s drifting snow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The unchangeable God’s love so earnestly preached here one hundred years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We still offer men the same salvation just as full and as copiously free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The men of the land and the men of the sea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The invitation by sermon has been offered every week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The choir provides fine music while the spiritually hungry at their Father’s table do eat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They then go out and tell others who are happy to know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of a little Church Around the Corner where they may worship as they did one hundred years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And during the year of nineteen and twenty-nine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our congregations have followed along in the same old-fashioned line&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the total number of worshipers county 6195 who have passed through the Bethel’s door&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who prayed and sand in the same old time spirit of one hundred years ago and more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of this number 1957 burdened seamen knowing not where else to go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brought to this sacred altar their soul, their sin and their homesick feelings just as the homesick sailor lads did one hundred years ago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now the old time ships have unbent their sails&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And the old time seamen have fought their last gales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet to the aged Seamen’s Bethel sailors still come and go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just as they came here to worship one hundred years ago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The needy also came as in days of yore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For during 1929 we’ve materially cared for just eighty-four&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forty of these men were destitute and sorely in need&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five had been shipwrecked and were stranded indeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other than the Mariner’s Home they knew not where to go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just as shipwrecked and stranded seamen sought its shelter one hundred years ago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also we’ve cared for the afflicted, the sick and the dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ninety-one services for the departed we’ve said&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of this number sixty-eight were men of the sea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or a member of a sailor’s family as the case might be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This custom has always been followed as past records will show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the birth of this society one hundred years ago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So you’re speaking out old Bethel, you’re declaring to burdened men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What a joy, what a blessing to aching heart these long years you’ve been&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like a beacon on the hilltop you’ve helped to guide the straying seamen home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The weather vane at your truck the changing winds to men you’ve shown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And to the wanderer far and near, high and low&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve proven that God’s love is not fickle like the wind, or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shifting like the weather vane, but it’s always the same just as it was one hundred years ago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The aged barks of faithfully revolving on your lofty spine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflects the fancies of your worthy sires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our father modeled that ship this sailors’ church to adorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To show to men whether the wind blows east or west or gale be short of long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They, too, need a ship and a pilot who can outride every blow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just as that ship has weathered every gale since one hundred years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When men read the tablets that tell the saddened tale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of the way those brave fellows were stricken down by shark, by whale or gale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our hearts turn to God in deep gratitude and in sincere prayer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because those old time sailor men placed these cenotaphs there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If our dear ones are in the great and mighty deep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sit not on its shore line in sorrow, grieve and weep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If they have no cenotaph to mark their final resting place&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s enshrine them in our hearts there we’ll find an open space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then that tablet you may carry with you every single place you go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s the way the cenotaphs to the sacred memory our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Bedford seamen started just one hundred years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Rev. Mr. Thurber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Experience with the 1910 Census</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/highlights/1910census/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-25T17:44:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/highlights/1910census</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hooray! I finished my first assignment for HIST 298!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before Winter Break, my supervisor and I sat down to discuss what at the time seemed like a long and grueling project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Go through the 1910 census (all six wards and corresponding precincts in each), and create a spreadsheet with the following info: every time you find a Jewish resident, take down their name, occupation, language spoken, year of immigration, where they are from, and where their parents are from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the corresponding UMass microfilm reel was missing (and my interlibrary loan was denied,) I had to use the university library’s subscription to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/new/www.ancestrylibrary.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ancestry&lt;/a&gt;. (This had a silver lining: while I didn’t get the experience of using microfilm, it allowed me to work on the project from home during the intersession.) On Ancestry, I was able to view all six wards and districts to search for Jewish residents to add to my database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a clear-cut way of identifying a Jewish resident from the rest of the population, though there were some obvious clues. The quickest way, as my supervisor pointed out to me, was by reading through “Language” and Birthplace.” Interestingly enough, the census takers categorized various birthplaces. For example, a birthplace of Russia could be followed by subcategories like “German,” “Lithuanian,” or (as I was looking for) “Yiddish.” In later wards, “Yiddish” was substituted for “Jewish” or “Hebrew.” (I’m curious if this was a personal preference of the census takers or the families recorded.) The majority of the Jewish residents were Russian, though I also found several Austrians, Germans, and Hungarians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within each district, the census grouped families– not necessarily related families, but people living together. Most commonly, I would see a husband and wife and (depending on their age) their children. But oftentimes these families included in-laws, aunts and uncles, cousins, employees, or boarders. Usually, the male was the head of the household – however, if the wife was a widow with children, she would be considered the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were specifically interested in their employment. (I don’t have much background on the various districts, so I do wonder if certain districts were for segregated by class. It appeared that many people employed by the same establishment lived nearby each other.) Most residents worked for a dry goods store (as peddlers or merchants) or in a cotton mill. The most interesting professions were four Hebrew teachers, three rabbis, and one pin boy at the bowling alley!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult aspect of the project was deciphering handwriting. Ancestry has an index for most of the information, making it easy to scan through several pages in a row. But some of the occupations were almost illegible – my friends and I had fun attempting to make some guesses as to what they might be referring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the project took several hours. But it gave me a better basis of the New Bedford community during the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries. For example, I knew there was large Portuguese population in the New Bedford area, but it’s a completely different realization when I saw each name on the paper. I wrapped my head around the idea that these massive immigrant populations, discussed in my high school history textbooks as “in the major cities,” were represented in smaller, local cities as well. I feel these topics are often overlooked in education – we learn through overviews, and tend to overlook the relevance to local history. I’m glad to be participating in research that emphasizes the importance of communities and local history that we don’t always get the chance to learn in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My course is coming to a close! The final assignment is to write a research paper about some aspect of Southeastern New England history – a person, a place, an event, etc. For my paper, I chose &lt;strong&gt;The Gifts of Henry Huttleston Rogers,&lt;/strong&gt; a multimillionaire of Standard Oil who chose to donate several buildings and industries to his hometown of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to share my paper with all of you, but I am actually in the process of turning this into a book! However, I do have some of the online sources that I used for my paper and that can inform those of you who are interested. &lt;/p&gt;
