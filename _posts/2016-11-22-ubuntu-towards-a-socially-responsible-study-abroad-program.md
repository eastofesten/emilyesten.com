From EdSurge Independent:

> <p id="11fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
>   On my two-week summer intensive trip to South Africa, my professor reiterated the course mission statement: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ubuntu. </em>A philosophy used in southern Africa, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ubuntu</em> emphasizes a universal bond among humanity:“I am what I am because of who we all are.” Recognizing the humanness and kindness among individuals, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ubuntu </em>speaks to a level of interconnectedness. It asks us to enrich ourselves by enabling the community around us, the crucial blocks for building global engagement.

>   While we visited the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown and in our travels around Johannesburg, I made a conscious effort to incorporate <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ubuntu </em>into my framework of thinking. Throwing myself into a completely different culture, even for a short amount of time, I found the concept of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ubuntu </em>to be both demonstrative and healing.
