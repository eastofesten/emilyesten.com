Headline/Title: Revolutionary LGBTQ Activists in the 20th Century

Blurb:

What, When, Where:  [The Most Revolutionary: LGBTQ Politics and the Radical Left, 1969-1999](https://www.waygay.org/news/2019/8/30/new-exhibit-to-open-on-lgbt-politics-and-the-radical-left). Through December 27, 2019 at the William Way LGBT Community Center, 1315 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19107. Open every day.

Displayed inside the community center's library,

Co-curated by John Anderies and Brad Duncan, the exhibit uses materials from **Duncan's private collection, the Center's Wilcox Archives, and loans from Philadelphia activists.**

The narrative of the late-20th LGBTQ rights movement is dominated in the struggle for marriage equality, **something**, and the AIDS crisis. And while all of those issues are important and should be recognized as part of LGBTQ activism, the exhibit also takes visitors through this thirty-year period, highlighting radical activist groups who **resisted the push toward accommodation and assimilation** to assert queerness in solidarity against all forms of oppression.

The button collection along the back wall is - who doesn't love a good political button?

Most exciting for me was the balance between Philadelphia ephemera and the United States at-large. Posters included addresses for buildings still in the Gayborhood.
**All politics is local**, and knowing the city was a haven for queer people then just as now was reaffirming.

Gay activism post-Stonewall

Though mainstream issues like the [military](idk), [nondiscrimination protections](idk), and [parenting](idk) are still at the forefront of LGBTQ activism, the radical left has re-emerged in today's political landscape. Prison abolitionism, harm reduction, **something**. Right here in Philly, take a look at the socialists marching at Philly Pride with signs like "Queer Liberation, Not Rainbow Capitalism" in response the the [corporatization of the city's Pride celebration](idk).
