I&#8217;ve visited this installation twice now, and I&#8217;m fascinated by its data-as-art example. (Is this a common trend in art that I just haven&#8217;t gotten around to yet?) It&#8217;s in the newly renovated _American Presidents_ wing at the National Portrait Gallery, which is a treat in itself to visit.

&#8220;Hindsight Is Always 20/20&#8221; is a fairly standard word cloud gimmick, using eye charts as a way to visualize frequency of words. I&#8217;ve never really thought of distant reading as hindsight, but I suppose DuBois may be onto something here. Of course, I have many questions about how effective this actually is. For one, you can&#8217;t tell what the difference is between each line&#8217;s frequency. It&#8217;s also unclear if DuBois has filtered any words from this ([He has, and he&#8217;s also made it so that words don&#8217;t repeat.](http://hindsightisalways2020.net)) What does that do to this as a review of these charts?

The phrase is, of course, pretty great for this installation – but I think I love it more because of the use of eye charts. Because these are tests of _vision_ – in the same way that State of the Union addresses represent a test of vision for a President as they enter a new year of the administration. (DuBois goes into this in more detail [on his site](http://hindsightisalways2020.net), but it just feels really clever that I had to point it out myself.)

I&#8217;m also interested in the fact that the description notes this installation as &#8220;the lexicon of each presidency.&#8221; I really want to see someone take these apart historically – go back to the SOTU addresses, connect them with their histories or historic events. I mean, just as distant reading normally functions, this can be used as a jumping-off point to understanding these presidencies. Combined with the portraits, we can perhaps reconstruct a president&#8217;s self-image and vision for the America he sought to shape.  And how do those relate to the way we view these presidencies now – either as a public or as historians?

Taking it further that DuBois points out, the lexicon of the presidency as a position. What issues can we glean from viewing these as a set in addition to individuals? Names of countries come up often, probably in reference to foreign diplomacy. Sometimes subjects are references explicitly – _banking_, _economy_, _Indians_, _slavery_ – but many of these are related words, for which we must reconstruct. What words do we use to dance around other subjects, like _war_? And _is_ hindsight always 20/20? What about the words that show up lower on the chart? What about the words that repeat.
