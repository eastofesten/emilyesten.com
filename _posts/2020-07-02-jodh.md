Earlier this week, I announced the launch of the [Digital Second Edition of Judaica Americana](https://singermanja2.exhibits.library.upenn.edu/). This is an Omeka database which draws from Robert Singerman’s *Judaica Americana,* a bibliography chronicling American Jewish book production until 1900. The Digital Second Edition contains 3,000 supplemental entries to the print edition. The project’s features allow users to search the bibliography by author, language, holding institution, and various tags, as well as find open-access links to digitized Jewish monographs, serials, and periodicals.

The datasets for that project, including their construction and reuse, are discussed at-length in my newest article for the *Journal of Open Humanities Data*. The article is released under a Creative Commons Atttribtion License (CC-BY 3.0). I've re-published the full-text of the article below, but it was first published for the Journal.
