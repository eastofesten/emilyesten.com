More for me than for you: some favorite readings this semester across the three classes I took. Links when possible.

[INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL RACE THEORY](https://blogs.brown.edu/amst-2220j-s01-2017-fall/)

  * **Crenshaw, K. (1991). Mapping the margins: Intersectionality, identity politics, and violence against women of color. _Stanford law review_, 1241-1299. <http://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039>. &#8211; **Why you can&#8217;t just throw around the term _intersectionality,_ but also exploring what that means for the institutions that perpetuate violence._ _
  * **Alexander, M. (2012). _The new Jim Crow: Mass incarceration in the age of colorblindness_.** &#8211; Totally slept on this and was pretty excited about finally having a chance to read it.

  * **Williams Jr, R. A. (1997). Vampires anonymous and critical race practice. _Michigan Law Review_, 741-765. <http://www.jstor.org/stable/1290045>** &#8211; I went into Prof. Keene&#8217;s office after reading this and talked about how amazing it is! I think it sums up a lot of my feelings on academia in general, and why public humanities feels like a better fit for me.
  * **Tuck, E., & Yang, K. W. (2012). Decolonization is not a metaphor. _Decolonization: Indigeneity, education & society_, _1_(1). [http://decolonization.org/index.php/des/article/download/18630/15554.](http://decolonization.org/index.php/des/article/download/18630/15554)** &#8211; Again, another article that is referenced all the time and I have totally missed. Thinking of the popularity of decolonizing, especially in the current moment, and how to address what that actually means in context.
  * **Bergerson, A. A. (2003). Critical race theory and white racism: Is there room for white scholars in fighting racism in education? _Qualitative Studies in Education_, 16(1), 51-63. &#8211; **Short answer: no. Long answer: maybe?
  * **Salis Reyes, Nicole Alia. 2017. A Space for Survivance: Locating Kānaka Maoli through the Resonance and Dissonance of Critical Race Theory. _Race Ethnicity and Education, _(In Press). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13613324.2017.1376632" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://doi.org/10.1080/13613324.2017.1376632 .</a>**<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13613324.2017.1376632" target="_blank" rel="noopener">  </a>&#8211; In general, reading various offshoots of CRT. I found this one particularly relevant in the discussions around Mauna Kea and the TMT, and well-articulated in its connection between the Hawaiian language and CRT tenets.
  * **Yosso, T. J. (2005). Whose culture has capital? A critical race theory discussion of community cultural wealth. _Race ethnicity and education_, _8_(1), 69-91. [http://www.artslb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Whose-culture-has-capital-A-critical-race-theory-discussion-of-community-cultural-wealth-Tara-Yosso.pdf.](http://www.artslb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Whose-culture-has-capital-A-critical-race-theory-discussion-of-community-cultural-wealth-Tara-Yosso.pdf)**[ ](http://www.artslb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Whose-culture-has-capital-A-critical-race-theory-discussion-of-community-cultural-wealth-Tara-Yosso.pdf)Just saw this referenced [in another article](https://t.co/NJKOeJfTyn). &#8211; Particularly valuable for anyone planning to work with communities (and &#8220;seeking out&#8221; communities of color.)
  * **Stovall, D. O. (2004). School leader as negotiator: Critical Race Theory, praxis, and the creation of productive space. Multicultural Education, 12(2), 8-12. [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ781916.pdf.](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ781916.pdf)**[ ](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ781916.pdf)&#8211; My copy is all marked up with public humanities connections!

  * **“[The Net Is A Waste of Time](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/14/magazine/the-net-is-a-waste-of-time.html)” (Gibson)** – coming off a summer of reading early sci-fi, Gibson made SO much more sense.
  * **&#8220;[Public, First](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/83)” (Brennan); “[Lessons on Public Humanities from the Civic Sphere](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/75)” (Hsu)**, which should definitely be read together.
  * **[All My Blogs Are Dead](https://www.theawl.com/2015/02/all-my-blogs-are-dead/)” (Maness)** – more relevant now following the end of The Gothamist and Storify.
  * **[_Lizard Ramone in Hot Pursuit: A Guide to Archives for Artists and Makers _](http://www.provlib.org/hot-pursuit/downloads/Hot_Pursuit_readable.pdf)(Ferris) &#8211; **I want all archives to think about developing projects like this for the new(er) audiences they serve.
  * **“[alternate futures/usable pasts](http://nowviskie.org/2016/alternate-futures-usable-pasts/)” (Nowviskie)**
  * **“[Ten Rules for Humanities Scholars New to Project Management](http://nowviskie.org/handouts/DH/10rules.pdf)”** (Nowviskie) – new rules to live by
  * **“[#transform(ing)DH Writing and Research: An Autoethnography of Digital Humanities and Feminist Ethics](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/2/000209/000209.html)” (Bailey)** – also new rules to live by.
  * **“[I’m Leaving The Archival Profession: It’s Better This Way](https://medium.com/on-archivy/im-leaving-the-archival-profession-it-s-better-this-way-ed631c6d72fe)” (Drake)** &#8211; on professionalization, change, and institutions.

19<sup>th</sup> Century U.S. History (Survey), conveniently in [image form](https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/942476994259820544)

  * **Eric J. Chaput, “’The Rhode Island Question’: The Career of a Debate,” Rhode Island History 68 (Summer/Fall 2010): 47–76.** – Growing up so close to Rhode Island, I remember researching the Dorr Rebellion at some point during my childhood. We started off the class with this one (which was good pedagogically as students in Rhode Island and to set up the major conflicts discussed throughout the course.) We kept returning to the Dorr War in various conversations over the semester, and the Dorr War as centerpiece really helped me consider the course through this outlook.
  * **Raul Coronado, _A World Not to Come: A History of Latino Writing and Print Culture_ (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2013). &#8211; **Thinking again about speculative futures, intellectual histories, and connections with geography.
  * **Lisa Lowe, “History Hesitant,” Social Text 33 (December 2015): 85–107. **&#8211; Read in combination with Coronado (but also with CRT), Lowe feels much more present in our arguments.
  * **David Jaffee, A New Nation of Goods: The Material Culture of Early America (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010). **I think this is the third time I&#8217;ve read this book for a class now? Still learning new things each time.
  * **Caitin Rosenthal, “Slavery’s Scientific Management: Masters and Managers,” in Slavery’s Capitalism: A New History of American Economic Development, eds. Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2016): 62–86. **&#8211; To be honest, I didn&#8217;t read the title of the article before reading. I wrote SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT in big letters after the first or second paragraph before realizing my error. Particularly interesting from the technological standpoint, but also interested in reading the rest of the book.
  * **Megan Kate Nelson, Ruin Nation: Destruction and the American Civil War (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2012). &#8211; **Only knew Nelson from Twitter, really appreciated the opportunity to sit down and match her online work with print scholarship! Formed the basis of my thoughts on spatial history for the final paper.
  * **Amy Dru Stanley, “Slave Emancipation and the Revolutionizing of Human Rights,” in The World the Civil War Made, eds. Gregory P. Downs and Kate Masur, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2015), 269–303. **&#8211; How do we articulate human rights? I have never heard about the Supplementary Civil Rights Act, and found this larger debate regarding the extent of state sovereignty/liberties fascinating. Again, another book of which I&#8217;m hoping to read the rest.
