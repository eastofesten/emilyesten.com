Boellstorff, Tom. _Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human._ Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015: 114.

&nbsp;

Dealing with presence and immersion through communication stuck out to me as one of the key debates in Boellstorff that hadn&#8217;t occurred to me. In other conversations around VR/AR, immersion has so often been the goal of these projects – to the point where users no longer recognize/acknowledge the medium in which it takes place. _Second Life_ is neither VR nor AR, but it challenged me to think about the definition of _immersion_ being formed by sensory experiences as one that hinders this larger debate. Why do we consider that the &#8220;goal&#8221; of many virtual worlds, and is that a fair way to review the cultures/worlds that are produced inside?

Building on our conversations from last week around anonymity, authenticity, and boundary-making, I thought it fascinating to consider residents&#8217; language around the use of voice in _Second Life._ For many, the immersion comes from establishing those boundaries, not erasing them. (See circling of _extension, reminder, blur, break._) The words I didn&#8217;t circle were the emotionally-charged reactions: _destroy, doom, ruin._ I sympathize with these sorts of reactions, though I was particularly struck by Kimmy&#8217;s notion of &#8220;the whole tone of his voice&#8221; being recognizable after using the microphone. As someone who&#8217;s often told I&#8217;m difficult to read through text, there was something really sweet (or sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet) about being able to recognize those kinds of nuances in another person&#8217;s language. In a world where text is the primary (and only) mode of communication, how much more nuanced is the language of _Second Life_ in ways that Boellstorff doesn’t discuss here for world-building?

I also wondered what boundaries would be further highlighted by using voice in _Second Life_:

  * the international dimensions of the game (which Boellstorff gets into earlier on in the page as well as the conversation around time and Euro residents);
  * the purposes of people playing the game (social implications as referenced in the note &#8220;the tech in _[Limetown](http://www.limetownstories.com/),_&#8221; a fictional podcast about a neuroscience research facility gone horribly wrong. Are there examples of virtual worlds where this has happened?)
  * the privileged nature of senses in virtual worlds in general (the fact that tech invests _so_ much in visual experiences, and how sound often becomes secondary to that.)

What other boundaries or the virtual/actual would come forth in using voice in these spaces?
