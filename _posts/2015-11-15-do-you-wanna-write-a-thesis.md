I am by no means an authority on the subject of an undergrad thesis. That’s exactly why I’m starting this next series of posts. I’m documenting this project as a reverse guide to myself &#8211; for when I try to do this again for my MA.

I feel like there are a lot of ‘firsts’ that I’ve been through in undertaking this assignment &#8211; not because I didn’t have people to ask, but because it’s hard to find & connect with people who are going through the same stages. Often times, these questions seemed like stupidly obvious ones, but still ones that needed to be answered. A lot of the tutorials out there are made for grad students, who already have a leg up in some sense and have been through the motions of this before. I was looking for square one &#8211; simple answers for simple questions.

In the next couple weeks, I hope you’ll join me on my thesis adventure as I cover the basics of research. I’m writing similar issues on another blog, and so I’ll share those links here too. Mostly, I want to be able to document my thesis process in multiple ways &#8211; the questions I’ve had being a key component of that process.

_Note: For those of you who have followed my work for a long time, you&#8217;ll have noticed I shifted from Tumblr to WordPress for this work. While I still have Tumblr for personal use I feel it&#8217;s not the best platform for what I want to do in an academic sense. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of WordPress, but it&#8217;s better suited for this kind of blogging. _
