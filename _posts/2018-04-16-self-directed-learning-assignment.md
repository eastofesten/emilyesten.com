I&#8217;m not a very fidgety person, except for with my hands. I wear rings on my fingers so that I always have something to play with, I&#8217;ll often wrap hair elastics around my wrist for a quick play toy in class, and I mindlessly take apart paper clips in order to meld them into new shapes.Â Something about the stimulation for spinning and fidgeting around fingers keeps me focused on other things, though I&#8217;ve never really thought about what I&#8217;m doing or how my body does it.

For my self-directed learning assignment, I want to delve into the use of my fingers more deeply in the art of pen-spinning. Like DDR and the dancing game studies we&#8217;ve studied, there is a level of expertise associated with pen-spinning beyond the mindlessly activity we might do in a meeting or in the classroom. As a form of contact juggling, there is an intense skill involved while also considering the performance elements and art form behind the field.

I&#8217;m partially excited by the novelty of learning such an activity, but also delving into the direction of my hand movement. Wish me luck!
