Thursday was #AskAnArchivist on Twitter, so I took advantage of the opportunity to get in contact with archivists across the nation.  Here are some of the questions I asked:

<!-- more -->

**@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/USNatArchives" target="_blank">U.S. National Archives</a>: How do you explain your job to kids?**

  * “People in our govt make lots of photos, videos, maps, paper. We get that stuff ready for you to come see it.” 

**@<a href="http://www.twitter.com/LBJLibrary" target="_blank">LBJLibrary</a>: What’s your go-to fact about LBJ to bring up at parties?**

  * “Great question. My fave #LBJ story is him driving his #amphicar into the Pedernales River pretending that the brakes failed.”
  * “But #LBJ and #golf (cheating, telling people to let him win, etc.) is close second: <a href="http://lbjlibrary.tumblr.com/post/24952903516/one-sunday-in-early-1964-lbj-invites-aide-larry" target="_blank">Read the story here.</a>&ldquo;

**What’s the funniest moment you’ve ever had at your job?**

  * “Funny and not but I processed 105 folders and miss-numbered them throwing the whole series off. Funny now, but not then.” – <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hipster818" target="_blank">Erik Bauer</a>, Archivst and Museum Professional for the Peabody Institute Library
  * “Finding cherubs of high resemblance to Bobby Hill in the margins of medieval texts.” – <a href="http://www.twitter.com/freifraufitz" target="_blank">L. Kelly Fitz</a>
  * “We once found pigeons hanging out among a senator’s papers! #GradSchoolDidn’tPrepareMeForThat. We shooed away the pigeons and rehoused the records. No harm, no fowl.” – <a href="http://www.twitter.com/SenateHistory" target="_blank">U.S. Senate History</a>

**What’s the hardest part of your job on a day-to-day basis?**

  * “As a reference archivist,  find making time for focused, large-scale projects hardest; user access & Q’s always come first.” – <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MHS1791" target="_blank">MA Historical Society</a>
  * “Not having 28 hours in a day. So many things I want/need to do & not enough time.” – <a href="http://www.twitter.com/HiramCLibrary" target="_blank">Hiram College Library</a>
  * “Balancing time btwn the day-to-day and big, long-term projects. Preservation means planning!” – <a href="http://www.twitter.com/RoperCenter" target="_blank">Roper Center</a>
  * “Responding to people who say, I didn’t know we have an archives! Staying relevant, and electronic records” – <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jennyj1j" target="_blank">Jenny Johnson</a>, a corporate archivist
  * “Hard to quantify that. The general lack of funds/support for cultural heritage instns. is depressing tho.” – <a href="http://www.twitter.com/msjonesking" target="_blank">Morgan Jones-King</a> at SCArhives
  * “Kicking out an enthusiastic researcher when we close at 5pm is no fun!” – <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ALA_Archives" target="_blank">American Library Association Archives</a>
  * “Lack of support form the org/institution can be hard. Sometimes feel like you’re fighting a losing battle.” – <a href="http://www.twitter.com/CarolineRose85" target="_blank">Caroline</a>, a UK Archivist
