It’s getting to the end of the semester, but a lot of stuff has been happening.

<!-- more -->

Things I’m Doing: 

  * My internship at UMass Press has been going well &#8211; I’ve spent the majority of my semester developing their new blog, which was launched earlier this week. It’s given me a chance to really delve into scholarly publishing and research a number of publications by the Press in the last few years. Check out the blog <a href="https://t.co/GGpAXVbbjn" target="_blank">here</a>!
  * I went to see Angela Davis last Monday! As expected, she was a phenomenal speaker greeted by a standing ovation before and after her presentation. The _Massachusetts Daily Collegian_ has a good summary of the key points in her address. 
  * I also went to the Five College Digital Humanities Speaker Series presentation with D. Fox Harrell &#8211; you can read my reflection <a href="http://blogs.umass.edu/english302-russworm/2015/04/03/d-fox-harrell-phantasmal-media/" target="_blank">here </a>or the Storify by 5CollDH <a href="https://storify.com/5cDH/5colldh-speaker-series-d-fox-harrell" target="_blank">here</a>. 
  * I got to <a href="https://t.co/wakIboBEFn" target="_blank">use Google Glass</a>, despite it being way past its prime. 



Things I’m Reading: 

  * <a href="https://t.co/qb0SulJCjO" target="_blank">“How Do You Design the Library of the Future?” by Oxford University</a> &#8211; What is the history of the library? How do we use it today? Where is it headed? 
  * <a href="http://t.co/rRID4XCCiP" target="_blank">“Museums: Getting in the Game” &#8211; Digital Public History</a> &#8211; What do museums (or really, GLAMs) think of digitization?
  * <a href="http://t.co/F6hlmd5dd6" target="_blank">“’Jews Aren’t Allowed to Use Phones’: Berlin’s Most Unsettling Memorial” by Ian Johnson </a>&#8211; A thought-provoking public history experiment.
