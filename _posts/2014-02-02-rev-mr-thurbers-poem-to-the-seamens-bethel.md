I&rsquo;ve been working through a few projects this past week for my internship, and working with the microfilm has certainly been exciting! (But more on that later.) One of my tasks was looking into the history of the plaque outside the Seamen&rsquo;s Bethel in New Bedford. I found this poem, printed in _The Morning Mercury_, which was read at the tablet&rsquo;s ceremony. <!-- more -->

_Just one hundred years ago_

_When people and ships were very slow_

_And this town was full of men and boys you know_

_Looking for a ship on a whaling voyage to go_

_They came from every shore and land_

_From Greenland’s icy mountains_

_From India’s coral strand_

_Where Afric’s sunny fountains_

_Roll down their golden sand._

_Like waifs upon the ocean they drifted o’er the Sea of Life_

_With few to aid or pity them as they struggled with sin and strife_

_‘Twas then our fathers saw the need_

_Of a “Seamen’s Bethel” so to grant them moral and_

_Spiritual shelter indeed_

_So the founding of this Bethel came within their sacred plan_

_For to snatch from the vile the vicious and the brothel every single sailor man_

_How well their work was finished we want the world to know_

_For the Sailor’s Church our fathers builded has lived through gale, flood, and fire since one hundred years ago._

_The builders of this Seamen’s Bethel have long since gone to their eternal rest_

_Our ships with their crews of that ago their final resting places well – God knows best_

_But the “Seamen’s Bethel” treasured and held in hallowed memory by them so_

_Still lives for she was founded upon a rock one hundred years ago._

_In a twofold manner ‘tis not fiction but ‘tis true_

_That boulder girths our harbor and it binds Johnny Cake Hill too_

_Upon that rock this dear old Bethel stands_

_Still another rock is her foundation which can ne’er be destroyed by the use of mortal hands_

_With that truth the hearts of our fathers were aglow_

_Our fathers who preached here one hundred years ago_

_For Christ is that rock upon which she is founded_

_By His “Sea of Love” like an island all men are surrounded_

_From her pulpit this theme has been preached through_

_Summer’s heat and winter’s drifting snow_

_The unchangeable God’s love so earnestly preached here one hundred years ago._

_We still offer men the same salvation just as full and as copiously free_

_The men of the land and the men of the sea_

_The invitation by sermon has been offered every week_

_The choir provides fine music while the spiritually hungry at their Father’s table do eat_

_They then go out and tell others who are happy to know_

_Of a little Church Around the Corner where they may worship as they did one hundred years ago._

_And during the year of nineteen and twenty-nine_

_Our congregations have followed along in the same old-fashioned line_

_For the total number of worshipers county 6195 who have passed through the Bethel’s door_

_Who prayed and sand in the same old time spirit of one hundred years ago and more_

_Of this number 1957 burdened seamen knowing not where else to go_

_Brought to this sacred altar their soul, their sin and their homesick feelings just as the homesick sailor lads did one hundred years ago_

_Now the old time ships have unbent their sails_

_And the old time seamen have fought their last gales_

_Yet to the aged Seamen’s Bethel sailors still come and go_

_Just as they came here to worship one hundred years ago_

_The needy also came as in days of yore_

_For during 1929 we’ve materially cared for just eighty-four_

_Forty of these men were destitute and sorely in need_

_Five had been shipwrecked and were stranded indeed_

_Other than the Mariner’s Home they knew not where to go_

_Just as shipwrecked and stranded seamen sought its shelter one hundred years ago_

_Also we’ve cared for the afflicted, the sick and the dead_

_Ninety-one services for the departed we’ve said_

_Of this number sixty-eight were men of the sea_

_Or a member of a sailor’s family as the case might be_

_This custom has always been followed as past records will show_

_Since the birth of this society one hundred years ago_

_So you’re speaking out old Bethel, you’re declaring to burdened men_

_What a joy, what a blessing to aching heart these long years you’ve been_

_Like a beacon on the hilltop you’ve helped to guide the straying seamen home._

_The weather vane at your truck the changing winds to men you’ve shown_

_And to the wanderer far and near, high and low_

_You’ve proven that God’s love is not fickle like the wind, or_

_Shifting like the weather vane, but it’s always the same just as it was one hundred years ago_

_The aged barks of faithfully revolving on your lofty spine_

_Reflects the fancies of your worthy sires_

_Our father modeled that ship this sailors’ church to adorn_

_To show to men whether the wind blows east or west or gale be short of long._

_They, too, need a ship and a pilot who can outride every blow_

_Just as that ship has weathered every gale since one hundred years ago._

_When men read the tablets that tell the saddened tale_

_Of the way those brave fellows were stricken down by shark, by whale or gale_

_Our hearts turn to God in deep gratitude and in sincere prayer_

_Because those old time sailor men placed these cenotaphs there_

_If our dear ones are in the great and mighty deep_

_Sit not on its shore line in sorrow, grieve and weep_

_If they have no cenotaph to mark their final resting place_

_Let’s enshrine them in our hearts there we’ll find an open space_

_Then that tablet you may carry with you every single place you go._

_That’s the way the cenotaphs to the sacred memory our_

_New Bedford seamen started just one hundred years ago._
