From Honors Student Blog:

> I know it’s a little early for me to be waxing poetic about the CHC experience – graduation is still VERY far away – but it was for an assignment. Each [BDIC](https://www.bdic.umass.edu/) student has to write a “Senior Summary” as their final graduation requirement. It’s half assessment – what did you actually do for your curriculum, what did you learn, what skills did you acquire, etc. – but it’s also half reflection on your BDIC career. It allows me to review what I’ve accomplished, and think about how to present it to future employers or graduate schools.
