While I&#8217;m playing the waiting game with grad school applications, I&#8217;m extremely excited for everything else going on in Spring 2016. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening:

  1. Events and (Un)Conferences: I&#8217;m currently scheduled to attend [History Camp](http://historycamp.org/boston-2016/) and [Hacking Heritage](http://blogs.brown.edu/hackingheritageunconference/) in March. And [Rebecca Onion is the Writer-in-Residence for UMass History](http://www.umass.edu/history/about/writerinresidence.html) this year, so I&#8217;m stoked!
  2. Thesis: I&#8217;ve been sharing my research story over at the [Honors Student Blog](https://www.honors.umass.edu/category/blog-column/taxonomy/term/717), and this semester will be all about the actual writing. I&#8217;ll also be working on the DH portion, and I expect this will take up the majority of my time.
  3. AppHuLL: The Applied Humanities Learning Lab is a Mellon-funded program intended to strengthen and clarify pathways from undergraduate humanities education to professional careers in the public and applied humanities. I&#8217;m one of fifteen Fellows this semester working with the Swift River Valley Historical Society. I just wrote a piece for [Past@Present](https://umasshistory.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/lessons-from-the-applied-humanities-learning-lab-2016/) about my experience in the J-term intensive.
  4. Smith: In my quest to attend all of the Five Colleges, I only have one left! I&#8217;m taking two courses there this semester, exploring the Sophia Smith archives and material culture at Historic Deerfield.
  5. UMass: It&#8217;s my last semester, and I plan to go out with a bang. I&#8217;m working on completing that [senior-year bucket list](http://fuckyeaumass.tumblr.com/100Things).
