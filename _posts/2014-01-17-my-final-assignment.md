My course is coming to a close! The final assignment is to write a research paper about some aspect of Southeastern New England history &#8211; a person, a place, an event, etc. For my paper, I chose **The Gifts of Henry Huttleston Rogers,** a multimillionaire of Standard Oil who chose to donate several buildings and industries to his hometown of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. 

I really want to share my paper with all of you, but I am actually in the process of turning this into a book! However, I do have some of the online sources that I used for my paper and that can inform those of you who are interested.
