[_note: title borrowed from this article _](http://themuse.jezebel.com/my-year-with-lin-manuel-miranda-or-how-to-find-a-hip-1748739548)

One of my [goals for 2015](http://emilyesten.com/words/my-work/2015-a-year-in-resolutions/) was to see _Hamilton_. I was six days too late,  but it was definitely a highlight of my year.

But for me, _Hamilton _has taken up more that that one day in January. Over the course of my senior year, it&#8217;s been the soundtrack of my life. So intimately intertwined in my growth and development of the past year, _Hamilton_ has been there through it all.

**August:** [_Hamilton _debuts on Broadway](http://www.playbill.com/article/the-verdict-read-critics-reviews-for-hamilton-on-broadway-com-356498). I (not so) subtly mention to my mom how cool the show seems to be. I read everyone reviews, and wonder how amazing the soundtrack must be. [I finish my summer internship with a George Washington event](https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/634537834360250368). I start packing for senior year. I start looking at my course list. I start thinking about this being my last year, and how much work I have left to do.

**September:** I move back to UMass for my final year. I start classes. I count the days until the _Hamilton _album is released, only to have it [drop on NPR](http://www.npr.org/2015/09/21/440925873/first-listen-cast-recording-hamilton) while I&#8217;m in class. I listen 3x a day until my [preorder downloads](http://www.playbill.com/article/the-verdict-billboard-calls-hamilton-best-rap-album-of-2015-read-more-cast-album-reviews-here-com-365565). My immediate favorite is [&#8220;My Shot.&#8221; ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjg4qG45t_MAhVo6IMKHWmODA8QFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F4cxvludVmQxryrnx1m9FqL&usg=AFQjCNGZY8KcdnExzsaz9oN2yWniQlqi-w&sig2=MifAN3qaECv-AiGX5PF3iA&bvm=bv.122129774,d.amc)

**October:** I tell Mom I&#8217;m buying tickets. Mom tells me it&#8217;s a Christmas present. I finish binge-watching _The West Wing _and love [Lin&#8217;s fancast for a musical](http://purplechrain.tumblr.com/post/124085376171/remember-that-time-lin-manuel-miranda-fancasted-a). I start applying to grad school. My brother and I perfect our routine to [&#8220;Farmer Refuted&#8221;](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi9oZzK5t_MAhVM04MKHawmD6kQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F2G9lekfCh83S0lt2yfffBz&usg=AFQjCNHH0hisO8lOJM1S3YNZc0BBRX2O7w&sig2=F_VmrDmAUVsWi-wA_Ykozg&bvm=bv.122129774,d.amc) on the ride home from school.

**November:** Friends start listening to <del></del>_Hamilton _&#8211; they also fall in love with it. I finish my literature review for my thesis! I&#8217;m rolling in _Hamilton _think pieces, and read them on my bus rides to Mount Holyoke. My favorite song now is definitely [&#8220;Satisfied,&#8221;](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi-hqSO8t_MAhULuBoKHVSRASAQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F3dP0pLbg9OfVwssDjp9aT0&usg=AFQjCNF1PBG1D54NyKMsy5MrMjacIuFpbA&sig2=qeLG3cCDVGFooYw6iWfFNw&bvm=bv.122129774,d.dmo) though I can&#8217;t sing as fast as Renee. And don&#8217;t even get me started on [&#8220;Guns and Ships&#8221;](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiGx--B8t_MAhUBGx4KHZB_CNUQFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F7m9XR7FquXLP1FewdAcNS9&usg=AFQjCNFgt5s6H0HewYVcUPvbW1n0TMseHA&sig2=scAjeJ9JFrfYBbK6mWqZCw) &#8211; I WISH I could rap like Daveed.

**December:** My sister and I have a great duet for [&#8220;Aaron Burr, Sir.&#8221;](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiGupfe5t_MAhVl1oMKHWMaDPIQFggfMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F6dr7ekfhlbquvsVY8D7gyk&usg=AFQjCNGYlVVEYi0WMeIE8OFbkHKgRblpbg&sig2=W5-6vyKdzXIxwDpQvKpwVw&bvm=bv.122129774,d.amc) We switch off, but I&#8217;m usually Hamilton. Along with our brother, we rock &#8220;The Schuyler Sisters&#8221; &#8211; I&#8217;m Angelica, she&#8217;s Eliza, he&#8217;s Peggy. I finally read Chernow&#8217;s _Hamilton _on a long flight to Indianapolis. It complements the show beautifully (or vice versa, rather.)

**January:** [I SEE _HAMILTON!_](https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/684796643644968960) I am amazed that this show I have been obsessing over can exceed my expectations. I meet Andrew Chappelle and Chris Jackson and Betsy Strux. [I participate in the Ham4Ham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2pTl9BgO4o).  I start listening to [_In the Heights_](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj91rL55d_MAhUq_4MKHfufDl0QFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fartist%2F6BrRyZRuy3RTzJjAXTc7Ts&usg=AFQjCNFqbsSq-0R71Zu9QwkzMJ0itfJMtg&sig2=LBPfQg6P7fsKw-uVzDj2hA), and start thinking how Lin wrote it as [a sophomore at Wesleyan](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi8jZGA6d_MAhVC9YMKHTLwBxQQFggtMAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2Farticle%2Fhow-lin-manuel-mirandas-in-the-heights-written-in-college-returned-to-his-alma-mater-com-335304&usg=AFQjCNGhpGeS4Dim1sO544eTdv9N9Mpj1w&sig2=k05QKQqiDxoEAJ_fGGZw1w&bvm=bv.122129774,d.amc). I start the first draft of my thesis, and start [writing like I&#8217;m running out of time](http://8tracks.com/hunter-e-burke/write-like-you-re-running-out-of-time).

**February:** I am accepted to my first grad school on the same day [_Hamilton _performs at the Grammys](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/15/11010890/hamilton-lin-manuel-miranda-grammys-2016) ([and wins for Best Musical Theater Album!!!!](http://www.playbill.com/article/hamilton-wins-grammy-for-best-musical-theater-album-com-386468)) All my blog posts [subtly mention _Hamilton _lyrics](https://www.honors.umass.edu/blog/eesten/moral-voyage-take-break). I have a morning routine that starts with &#8220;Alexander Hamilton&#8221; and ends with &#8220;Satisfied.&#8221;

**March:** [The cast performs at the White House](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiJkvm75d_MAhWk1IMKHYUKBSgQyCkIHzAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZPrAKuOBWzw&usg=AFQjCNFaO-4oArKkDy6QU6KyAAuet0hpRQ&sig2=A6BcthL5-6axMYaHRNHxNA). I visit DC at the end of the month to check out a grad school. I pick up [a copy of _Arrive _with Lin on the cover](http://linmnuelmrnda.tumblr.com/post/140300911523/lin-manuel-miranda-for-arrive-magazine-2016) on the train ride down. I come home for spring break. I hear [Rebecca Onion speak on history and the Internet](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi1toHH6N_MAhUozIMKHV4GBxAQtwIINjAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEIvAIyyZSZU&usg=AFQjCNH53Rz9Eh2pyB97ww9Vv6k-iiwYZQ&sig2=RhCiQ4VQixYdUMiwUvw_Eg), and cringe at her article re: [Tumblr&#8217;s founding fathers fandom](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiX64W86N_MAhVm3IMKHUgkBj4QFggdMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnymag.com%2Fselectall%2F2016%2F03%2Finside-tumblrs-founding-fathers-fandom.html&usg=AFQjCNFJIrIsjbA05Q-JTS6qJU0X-myq5g&sig2=X6d_0v7IBK12mR7cog98vA). The _Hamiltome _is published, but I don&#8217;t have time to read through it.

**April:** I pick a grad school. [I defend my thesis](https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/724649699119128580). I finish my finals a little early, and start to say goodbye to UMass. _Hamilton_ is nominated for an [unprecedented sixteen Tonys](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwicwfjS6N_MAhWn3YMKHdxCBKMQFggdMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F05%2F04%2Ftheater%2Fhamilton-tony-nominations-record.html&usg=AFQjCNE-yIaiTzoUW1q73lmUOpe1yBTD_Q&sig2=NjBFzBHtNDAzUXpoFuqUag), and we learn that [Alexander Hamilton will be staying on the $10](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi6roft6t_MAhWp64MKHSANCZoQFggkMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2Farticle%2Ftreasury-secretary-to-announce-that-hamilton-will-stay-on-10-bill-com-351602&usg=AFQjCNGB4kT0qYxRp0hLg-N5iGrMa-Qp6g&sig2=mqywinvPb9T9Ai1NweScbg), for the time being.

**May:** I graduate on one of the rainiest days ever, and get soaked at commencement. [My first cap](https://twitter.com/sheishistoric/status/728201636900933634) doesn&#8217;t survive the rain, but my friend salvages the pieces and [makes a new one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFF6FFhLWxCzfJXg7Bt3UB9q6_lvd4ajH2IPx00/). (I help.) [Lin gives a commencement speech at UPenn](http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/16/lin-manuel-miranda-commencement-speech-hamilton).

So here&#8217;s to the cast of _Hamilton_: the soundtrack of my senior year.
