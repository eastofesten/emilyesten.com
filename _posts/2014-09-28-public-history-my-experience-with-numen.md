So in my public history a few weeks back, we were discussing how we as students have interacted with public history. The professor encouraged us to share our own experiences with museums &#8211; something fun, something different, something that made history come alive.

I have a lot of memories that I could share about museums &#8211; I mean, I&rsquo;ve been on plenty of family vacations and adventures of my own where I&rsquo;ve been surprised or excited or learned something new at a museum. But there is one moment in particular that I remembered as _different_ than the others &#8211; and though I didn&rsquo;t share it in class, I&rsquo;d like to share it here.

When I was fifteen, I joined a local school&rsquo;s trip to London, which at the time was my absolute dream vacation. I had always loved Harry Potter and so I saw England and the United Kingdom as this fantastically posh place where all excitement seemed to happen. I read the itinerary nightly in the months leading up to the trip, finding all of the exciting places I would go. 

At the time, i wasn&rsquo;t totally sure that I wanted to go into history &#8211; I just knew it was something I liked, something I was interested in. And so, a place like the British Museum seemed really cool on paper &#8211; and I was excited to go. But walking into the museum was something else &#8211; for lack of better words, it took my breath away. Someone pointed out to me that I didn&rsquo;t smile the entire time I was in the museum &#8211; something I too noticed. I was so overwhelmed by sheer size of the collections, the information, and the building itself &#8211; there was so much to take in. I saw all the notable items &#8211; the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, the Assyrian Bulls &#8211; but I felt out of place. I had been to many museums before, but this was different &#8211; this was a world in which I had little context and little background that I was unsure what to make of it. 

Flash forward two years later, when my family spent our Christmas vacation in London. I was a different person than the girl who had made her way to London as a sophomore &#8211; it was my senior year of high school, I&rsquo;d just been accepted to UMass Amherst (literally just the day before), and I had expanded my knowledge of history to the point where I had actually decided to be a history major. I had been looking forward to returning to the place that had once mystified me. 

I don&rsquo;t think I ever stopped smiling once I entered the museum. It was truly amazing how different the building looked to me &#8211; no longer intimidating and filled with a hodgepodge of items, but fascinating and filled with knowledge I could actually comprehend. Time didn&rsquo;t seem to pass  felt like an _aha! _moment &#8211; realizing how comfortable and at ease the museum made me. 

This is a common desire of people visiting museums, historic houses and sites &#8211; _numen._ It&rsquo;s a bit difficult to explain exactly what _numen _is, but it&rsquo;s not far from what I described.  A &ldquo;deep engagement or transcendence&rdquo; a form of empathy, or an &ldquo;awe of reverence&rdquo; allows visitors to experience something very personal when experiencing history. And I&rsquo;m searching to find that feeling in every museum I visit &#8211; greeting this realm of public history like an old friend.
