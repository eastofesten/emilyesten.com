Somehow, I ended up getting ahead on my assignments (and took a break from studying for my HIST397GGH midterm on Thursday) and was able to get a lot of other work done!

  * <span>I applied for another internship: I&rsquo;ve now applied for three history-related internships in my area (and planning on one more), so I hope I&rsquo;ll hear something soon!</span>
  * <span>I also applied for a scholarship to attend a course this summer course about the Whitfield-Manjiro story and whaling history of Fairhaven.</span>
  * <span>I then emailed my supervisor about some of my leads in the Smithsonian Archives (on which I will probably write this week&rsquo;s blog post, because Archives are extremely complicated and I love it.)Â </span>
