# Other Projects

Outside of professional activities, I do some stuff for fun.

## Writing

I am a contributor to the [*Broad Street Review*](https://www.broadstreetreview.com/), a non-profit online arts and culture publication for the greater Philadelphia area. You can read my work [here](https://emilyesten.com/tags/broad+street+review/). 

## Twitter Bots
I manage some Twitter bots.

- @[UMass_Horoscope](https://twitter.com/UMass_Horoscope): A spreadsheet-powered Twitter bot to share the @[MDCollegian](https://twitter.com/MDCollegian) horoscopes. Built by @[zachwhalen](https://twitter.com/zachwhalen), modified by @[storybench](https://twitter.com/storybench), implemented by @[sheishistoric](https://twitter.com/sheishistoric).
- @[onlylistentoTMG](https://twitter.com/onlylistentoTMG): I only listen to @[mountain_goats](https://twitter.com/mountain_goats) â€“ can recommend any song for any mood. [source code](https://github.com/sheishistoric/onlylistentotmg)
- @[tmgdnd](https://twitter.com/tmgdnd): A bot that mashes @[mountain_goats](https://twitter.com/mountain_goats) lyrics with situations from Dungeons & Dragons. [source code](https://github.com/sheishistoric/tmgdnd)
- @[faketmglyrics](https://twitter.com/faketmglyrics): a Markov chain bot for @[mountain_goats](https://twitter.com/mountain_goats) lyrics. [source code](https://github.com/sheishistoric/faketmglyrics)

I've written about my interest in making Twitter bots and my love for the Mountain Goats [here](https://emilyesten.com/highlights/i-only-make-bots-for-the-mountain-goats/).
