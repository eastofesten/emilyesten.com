########### Profile ###########
profile: I work in digital public humanities, which means proactively engaging with audience, content, and methods in relation to the projects we build with technology and data. I create and apply digital tools to foster connection and dialogue around cultural heritage. Having played an active role in shaping collaborations, training, and programming around understanding data, I am especially excited to tackle data-related projects and educate others to do the same.

profile-public: Over five years of working in higher education and cultural institutions, I have explored different approaches to developing effective digital content. I practice digital public humanities, bringing my love for museums and my interest in digital tools together to give audiences agency in their participation and engagement.

profile-digital: With universities and cultural institutions, I work on innovative digital projects to engage audiences with objects, stories, and ideas.

#profile-writing: I am a freelance writer on arts, pop culture, and public history. Most of my work has been as a contributor to the <a href="https://www.broadstreetreview.com/">Broad Street Review</a>, a non-profit online arts and culture publication for the greater Philadelphia area. You can read my work <a href="https://emilyesten.com/tags/broad+street+review/">here</a>.

This digital copy will be available as a file, dataset, and searchable database. Through JA2, we expect to provide researchers, book trade specialists, genealogists, and bibliographers with the information they will need to mine this invaluable resource.

    details: "Scribes of the Cairo Geniza is a multilingual crowdsourcing project to classify & transcribe fragments of medieval and premodern manuscripts from the Cairo Geniza. With an in-kind grant from the Zooniverse, the largest crowdsourcing platform in the world, along with institutional and image partners from The University of Pennsylvania Libraries, The Princeton Geniza Lab, The e-Lijah Lab and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research of the Cairo Genizah at the University of Haifa, the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary, the Genizah Research Unit at Cambridge University Library, The University of Manchester Library, and The Bodleian Libraries at University of Oxford, we are harnessing the power of technology to decipher some of the most difficult to read fragments in the world. We see this project as a way for people with shared interests and different skill levels from around the world to meet in a common endeavor. We see this as a way to develop new tools for the public to learn to read a variety of scribal hands and to open texts accessible only to a handful of specialists to millions of people. As the project manager, I work with a team of researchers, curators, and volunteers to develop a comprehensive approach towards fostering public participation in research. I led the launch of two new user tasks in the project; ran user testing on three additional user tasks, and coordinated with translators and content experts to review content and materials. I have also developed workflows for data collection and review so that scholars can monitor and track the progress of the project. In developing our interface and engagement strategy, I have hosted in-person and livestreamed events, recorded instructional videos, developed promotional materials, and curated images from our image library to engage users.
