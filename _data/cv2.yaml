########### Profile ###########
profile: "I am a digital scholar, a public humanities practitioner, and public historian. I’m currently the Judaica Digital Humanities Project Coordinator for Penn Libraries and assist with Contingent Magazine."

profile-public: I practice digital public humanities, bringing my love for museums and my interest in digital tools together. I think about how community building, engagement, and development in relation to the humanities can be augmented or transformed for the better with technology. My passion is for collaborating on public projects that think critically about audience, content, and method. I'm an ardent supporter of <a href="">#MuseumsAreNotNeutral</a>, a campaign that urges museum professionals to acknowledge and address social realities, and believe museums are most responsive when we bring people ad collections together to benefit our communities.

profile-digital: With universities and cultural institutions, I build innovative digital projects to engage audiences with objects, stories, and ideas. My philosophy for collaborating on digital projects comes from Allison Parrish's <a href="http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/programming-forgetting-new-hacker-ethic/">"Hacker Questions"</a>.
