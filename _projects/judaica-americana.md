The [**Digital Second Edition of Judaica Americana**](https://singermanja2.exhibits.library.upenn.edu/), an Omeka bibliographic database, draws from Robert Singerman’s Judaica Americana, a bibliography chronicling American Jewish book production until 1900. Visitors can search the [database’s](https://singermanja2.exhibits.library.upenn.edu/) 9,600+ bibliographic entries for author, language, holding institution, and various tags, as well as find open-access links to digitized Jewish monographs, serials, and periodicals. *Judaica Americana* authoritatively chronicles American Jewish book production from the seventeenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century. The second edition contains an additional 3,000 entries. Taken as a whole, Singerman’s bibliography provides extensive documentation of American Jewish communal activity and growth before 1901.

I was responsible for the data preparation and project methodology. As the developer and designer, I designed the look and feel of the site, editing the Omeka theme that is used for the navigation and user interaction with the site.
