The Sabato Morais Digital Repository is a searchable database that performs full-text searching of correspondence and other papers in the Sabato Morais Papers, displaying the images of retrieved documents alongside their encoded transcription. By making these writings and correspondence of Sabato Morais digitally available, researchers have access to primary sources that document the development of observant Jewish life in the broad context of Victorian culture on both sides of the Atlantic during the nineteenth century. This project is of interest to scholars of American, Italian and Sephardic Jewish history, religious studies, immigration and ethnic studies, Hebrew language and the history of Biblical interpretation, and the history of scholarship.
