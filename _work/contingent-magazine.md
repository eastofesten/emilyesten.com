**History is for everyone.**
**Every way of doing history is worthwhile.**
**Historians should be paid for their work.**

Everything at *Contingent Magazine* is rooted in these three principles. When the editors approached me about their idea for the website, I was thrilled to join *Contingent* in building their online presence.
