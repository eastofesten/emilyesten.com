As the Digital Humanities Fellow at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, I spearheaded conversations about growing digital initiatives at the Institute. On a day-to-day basis, I collaborated with Education and Visitor Experience as well as the Information Technology departments to update website, tablet, and projection content and displays for visitors. 

I also developed two iPad applications as in-gallery interactives. For each application, I led a prototyping team from two departments to discuss visitor needs, design interests, and technological concerns for future updates to the applications. Finally, I started internal conversations about the use of virtual and augmented realities at the Institute. I performed an environmental scan of the uses of these technologies in museum spaces and provided a series of questions regarding sustainability, accessibility, and development of any virtual experiences for educational potential.  In all of these projects, I worked with the visitor experience team to establish a foundation of talking about technology with the IT department, and addressing how technology could transform educational experiences for a variety of audiences.
