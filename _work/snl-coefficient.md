*Saturday Night Live*’s legacy in the comedy industry is rarely questioned. But as researchers, we can question how to quantify and represent this legacy in terms of data. Starting with the concept of “*Saturday Night Live* films”, the franchises spun off from sketches on the late night show, we suggest a method of determining the SNL coefficient of a piece of media based on the presence and significance of current and former *SNL* cast members and writers in its creation. Sparking an intriguing conversation on the show’s legacy and the networks behind the scenes of today’s comedy industry, this data set also creates a wealth of *SNL* trivia for fans of the show. In this article, we dig into the filmographies of over 250 current and former *SNL* cast members and writers to understand how the show, in over nearly 50 years, spawned a quantifiable professional network of writers and performers that had manifested in multiple platforms (television, film, online content, etc.) as well as in multiple genres beyond comedy.
And we’ll prove that *Mean Girls* should be remembered as an *SNL* feature film.
